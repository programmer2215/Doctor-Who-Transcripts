[Albert Embankment]
(On the south side of the River Thames in London, across from Thorney Island and the Houses of Parliament, a crowd is gathered as Big Ben chimes three o'clock and a dinosaur roars at it.)
POLICEMAN: Come on, out of the way. Move yourself, please. Coming through. That's it. Excuse me, sir.
(A trio are escorted through the crowd to a police Inspector.)
GREGSON: Madame Vastra, thank God. I'll wager you've not seen anything like this before.
VASTRA: Well, not since I was a little girl.
JENNY: Big fella, isn't he?
VASTRA: Dinosaurs were mostly this size. I do believe it's a she.
JENNY: No, they weren't, I've seen fossils.
VASTRA: I was there.
GREGSON: Well, that's all well and good, but what's this dinosaur fellow doing in the Thames?
(The Tyrannosaurus Rex is pacing and bellowing in the river, and still standing taller than the Elizabeth Tower, then known simply as the Clock Tower because of the four clock faces and Big Ben housed within it. That makes the creature well over 315 feet or 96 metres tall. Naturally, the crowd screams.)
VASTRA: It must have time travelled. Jenny?
(Jenny holds up a hand-scanner, which is part of her glove.)
GREGSON: Time travelled?
(The dinosaur tries to cough something up.)
JENNY: Is it choking?
VASTRA: There seems to be something lodged in its throat.
JENNY: How could it time travel?
VASTRA: I don't know. Perhaps it was something it ate.
(The dinosaur manages to dislodge the obstruction in its throat, and a small blue box with a light on top flies out of its mouth to land right way up on the riverbank below the crowd.)
GREGSON: Stand back. Stand back, stand back.
(He pushes his way forward to a better vantage point.)
GREGSON: Well, it's just laid an egg.
VASTRA; It's dropped a blue box marked Police out of its mouth. Your grasp of biology, it troubles me.
JENNY: It's the Tardis.
VASTRA: It would seem so.
JENNY: We'll take care of this, Inspector.
GREGSON: But what if that thing goes on the rampage?
(Vastra takes balls with three legs out of a sack.)
VASTRA: Place these lanterns on the shoreline and bridges, encircling the creature at twenty foot intervals.
GREGSON: What will they do?
VASTRA: They will emit a signal that will incline it to remain within their circumference. Jenny, Strax. With me.
(They go down the stone stairs to the river bank.)
JENNY: So it's him, then, the Doctor?
VASTRA: A giant dinosaur from the distant past has just vomited a blue box from outer space.

[River bank]

VASTRA: This is not a day for jumping to conclusions. Strax, if you wouldn't mind?
(Strax knocks on the Tardis door. It is smeared with sputum from its previous location.)
STRAX: Hello? Exit the box, and surrender to the glory of the Sontaran empire.
(A tall grey-haired man opens the door and looks out. Smoke comes out as well.)
DOCTOR: Shush.
(He shuts the door again.)
STRAX: Doctor?
(The door opens again.)
DOCTOR: I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I managed to give it the slip.
(The door shuts again, then is opened slowly.)
DOCTOR: Sleepy?
STRAX: Sir?
DOCTOR: Bashful? Sneezy? Dopey? Grumpy.
(Then he sees the two women and walks towards them.)
DOCTOR: Oh, you two. The green one and the not-green one. Or it could be the other way round, I mustn't prejudge.
(Clara appears, very dishevelled. She is wearing a black fitted jacket with an 'outline of bow tie' motif and tartan mini-kilt.)
DOCTOR: Oh, you remember, er. Thingy. The, er, the not-me one. The asking questions one. Names not my area.
CLARA: Clara.
DOCTOR: Well, it might be Clara. Might not be. It's a lottery.
CLARA: It is Clara.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not ruling it out.
(The dinosaur bellows.)
DOCTOR: Oi, big man, shut it. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too. Big woman, sorry.
CLARA: Doctor, listen to me. You, you need to calm down.
DOCTOR: (to dinosaur) I'm not flirting, by the way.
CLARA: I think something's gone wrong.
DOCTOR: Wrong? What's gone wrong? Have you regenerated? (to Clara) I remember you. You're Handles. You used to be a little, a little robot head, and now you. You've really let yourself go.
(The dinosaur bellows again.)
DOCTOR: Reduce the frequency.
CLARA: I'm sorry?
DOCTOR: Your sonic lanterns, turn them down. You're giving her a headache.
JENNY: Giving who a headache?
DOCTOR: My lady friend. Just an expression, don't get any ideas.
STRAX: How do you know?
DOCTOR: Come on, Clara. You know that I speak dinosaur.
CLARA: He's not Clara. I'm Clara.
DOCTOR: Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels? Why, why are you all doing that? Why are you? You're all going dark and wobbly. Stop that.
CLARA: I don't think we are.
DOCTOR: Never mind. Everyone take five.
(The Doctor closes his eyes, sways, then falls over.)
CLARA: What do we do?
JENNY: I don't understand. Who is he? Where's the Doctor?
CLARA: Right here. That's him. That's the Doctor.
VASTRA: Well then, here we go again.

[Guest bedroom]

(Nightime, with a full moon. At Vastra's house, the Doctor is now wearing a full length night shirt. Clara and Jenny are listening at the door.)
DOCTOR [OC]: It's simply misunderstandable to me. I don't know what it is. Who invented this room?
(He opens the door and Clara and Jenny nearly fall inside.)
CLARA: Doctor, please, you have to lie down.
DOCTOR: It doesn't make sense. Look, it's only got a bed in it. Why is there only a bed in it?
CLARA: Because it's a bed room. It's for sleeping in.
DOCTOR: Okay, what do you do when you're awake?
JENNY: You leave the room.
DOCTOR: So you've got a whole room for not being awake in. But what's the point? You're just missing the room. And don't look in that mirror. It's absolutely furious.
CLARA: Doctor, please. You have to lie down. You keep passing out.
DOCTOR: Well, of course I keep passing out. There's all these beds. Why do you keep talking like that? What's gone wrong with your accent? Why
JENNY: Nothing's wrong with her accent.
DOCTOR: You sound the same. It's spreading. You all sound all English. Now you've all developed a fault.
VASTRA: (with a Scots accent) Doctor, I need your help with something.
DOCTOR: Finally, someone who can talk properly.
VASTRA: I'm having difficulty sleeping.
DOCTOR Oh? Oh, well, I wouldn't bother with that, I never bother with sleep, and I just do standy-up catnaps.
VASTRA: Oh really, how interesting. And when do you do those?
DOCTOR: Well, generally whenever anyone else starts talking. I like to skip ahead to my bits. It saves time.
(Vastra gently leads him to the bed and they sit down.)
VASTRA: Save me time, Doctor. Project an image of perfect sleep into the centre of my mind.
DOCTOR: What, do you want a psychic link with me? The size of my brain, it would be like dropping a piano on you.
VASTRA: Be gentle, then.
DOCTOR: I'll try. Brace yourself. Piano.
(They put their fingers to the others temple. Boing! Doctor falls back onto the bed, sound asleep.)
VASTRA: (English accent) I love monkeys. They're so funny.
JENNY: Oh, I see. So people are monkeys now, are they?
VASTRA: No, dear. People are apes. Men are monkeys.
(They tuck the Doctor up in bed.)
CLARA: So what now?
VASTRA: He needs rest.
CLARA: So what do we do? How do we fix him?
JENNY: Fix him?
CLARA: How do we change him back?
VASTRA: Jenny, I will be in my chamber. Would you be kind enough to fetch my veil?
JENNY: Why, are we expecting strangers?
VASTRA: It would seem there's already one here.
(Vastra leaves.)
CLARA: What have I done wrong?
(The sound of a sad dinosaur drifts into the room.)
JENNY: The dinosaur doesn't seem very happy.
CLARA: What's wrong with it?
JENNY: I dunno. The Doctor's the one that speaks dinosaur. Excuse me, ma'am. The wife doesn't like to be kept waiting.
CLARA: Where did he get that face? Why's it got lines on it? It's brand new. How can his hair be all grey? He only just got it.
JENNY: It's still him, ma'am. You saw him change.
CLARA: I know. I do. I, I know that.
JENNY: Good.
CLARA: It's just
JENNY: What?
CLARA: Nothing. If. If Vastra changed, if she was different, if she wasn't the person that you liked?
VASTRA: I don't like her, ma'am. I love her. And as to different? Well, she's a lizard.
(Clara goes to the window and hears the moaning dinosaur.)
DOCTOR: I am alone. The world which shook at my feet, and the trees and the sky, have gone. And I am alone now. Alone.
CLARA: Are you translating?
DOCTOR: The wind bites now, and the world is grey, and I am alone here. Can't see me. Doesn't see me. Can't see me.
CLARA: Who can't see it? I think all of London can see it.
STRAX: Boy? Madame Vastra is waiting.
CLARA: Okay. Whatever.
STRAX: I will convey you to her chamber. May I take your coat?
CLARA: Not wearing a coat.
STRAX: What's all that?
CLARA: Clothes.
STRAX: May I take your clothes?
CLARA: (sotto) Probably not.
STRAX: Are you wearing a hat?
CLARA: It's hair.
STRAX: No, I think it's a hat. Would you like me to check?

[Street]

(The lamplighter is at work, and middle-aged couple are walking together.)
ALF: It's not real, of course.
ELSIE: What is it, then?
ALF: The government.
ELSIE: The government?
ALF: Yeah, up to their usual tricks.
ELSIE: It's a dinosaur, Alf. A real dinosaur.
ALF: I wouldn't put it past them.
ELSIE: You don't half talk a lot of rubbish, Alfie. See you don't stay out too late now.
ALF: You know me.
ELSIE: Yes. I do.
(She gives him a peck on the cheek and leaves. The lamplighter illuminates a man standing in the shadows. He turns with a click.)
ALF: It's the neck. That's what's wrong with it. Just don't look realistic.
HALF-FACE MAN: You have good eyes.
ALF: Oh, I do, as it happens. Very good eyes. They're my greatest gift.
HALF-FACE MAN: I accept.
(The man takes a sharp two pronged fork from a case.)
ALF: What's that for?
HALF-FACE MAN: Your gift. I have bad eyes.
(The man turns towards Alf, to reveal that one eye and half his face is mechanical. Naturally, Alf screams.)

[Vastra's chamber]

(A conservatory. Vastra is sitting in her peacock chair. A fountain is playing.)
VASTRA: And then?
CLARA: Why are you wearing your veil?
VASTRA: And then?
CLARA: And then we got swallowed by a big dinosaur. You probably noticed.
JENNY: How did it happen?
CLARA: I don't know. I don't know. We were crashing about everywhere. The Doctor was gone. The Tardis went haywire.
JENNY: He's not gone. He's upstairs.
CLARA: Okay, he changed.
VASTRA: He regenerated. Renewed himself.
CLARA: Renewed. Fine.
VASTRA: Such a cynical smile.
CLARA: I'm not smiling.
VASTRA: Not outwardly. But I'm accustomed to seeing through a veil. How have I amused you?
CLARA: You said renewed. He doesn't. He doesn't look renewed. He looks older.
VASTRA: You thought he was young?
CLARA: He looked young.
VASTRA: He looked like your dashing young gentleman friend. Your lover, even.
CLARA: Shut up.
VASTRA: But he is the Doctor. He has walked this universe for centuries untold, he has seen stars fall to dust. You might as well flirt with a mountain range.
CLARA: I did not flirt with him.
VASTRA: He flirted with you.
CLARA: How?
VASTRA: He looked young. Who do you think that was for?
CLARA: Me?
VASTRA: Everyone. I wear a veil as he wore a face for the same reason.
CLARA: What reason?
VASTRA: The oldest reason there is for anything. To be accepted.
(Up in the guest bedroom, the Doctor wakes and sniffs the air. He gets out of bed and crawls around on the carpet, sniffing. He goes to the radiator and finds a piece of chalk which he uses to make marks on it.)
VASTRA: Jenny and I are married. Yet for appearance's sake, we maintain a pretence, in public, that she is my maid.
JENNY: Doesn't exactly explain why I'm pouring tea in private.
VASTRA: Hush now.
JENNY: Good pretence, isn't it?
VASTRA: I wear a veil to keep from view what many are pleased to call my disfigurement. I do not wear it as a courtesy to such people, but as a judgment on the quality of their hearts.
CLARA: Are you judging me?
VASTRA: The Doctor regenerated in your presence. The young man disappeared, the veil lifted. He trusted you. Are you judging him?
CLARA: How dare you? How dare you?

[Guest bedroom]

(The Doctor is writing on the floorboards. He stands when he hears the dinosaur, then goes to the door and opens it.)
DOCTOR: Door. Boring. Not me.
(He goes to the window and opens it.)
DOCTOR: Me.

[Vastra's chamber]

CLARA: Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor. Last of the five good 'uns. Stoic philosopher.
VASTRA: Superlative bass guitarist. The Doctor really knows how to put a band together.
CLARA: And the only pin-up I ever had on my wall when I was fifteen. The only one I ever had. I am not sure who you think you're talking to right now, Madam Vastra, but I have never had the slightest interest in pretty young men. And for the record, if there ever was anybody who could flirt with a mountain range, she's probably standing in front of you right now. Just because my pretty face has turned your head, do not assume that I am so easily distracted.
(Vastra is no longer wearing her veil. Jenny applauds.)
JENNY: Whoo. Whoo. Sorry.
VASTRA: Well, goodness me. The lake is ruffled at last. I often wondered what you'd be like when you lost your temper.
JENNY: Oi. Married.
VASTRA: The Doctor needs us, you more than anyone. He is lost in the ruin of himself, and we must bring him home.
CLARA: When did you stop wearing your veil?
VASTRA: When you stopped seeing it.

[Rooftops]

(The Doctor is making his way towards the river.)
DOCTOR: Oi. Oi. Oi, big, sexy woman. Oi. Sorry. Sorry, it's all my fault. My time machine got stuck in your throat. It happens. I brought you along by accident. That's mostly how I meet girls, but don't worry, I promise I will get you home. I swear. Whatever it takes, I will keep you safe. You will be at home again.
(The dinosaur suddenly bursts into flames. It roars in pain before collapsing.)
DOCTOR: Stop that. Who's doing that? No, don't do that.

[Vastra's chamber]

VASTRA: That came from the river.
JENNY: The dinosaur.
VASTRA: Strax! Bring the carriage, now!

[Street]

(The Doctor leaps from a roof into a tree. The upper bough breaks under the strain, dropping him down.)
DOCTOR: Argh. Argh. Oh.
(He finishes hanging upside down from the lowest branch by his knees. A hansom cab, or growler, trots into his view.)
DOCTOR: Halt. Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet.
CABBIE: You're what?
DOCTOR: Shut up, I was talking to the horse.
(The Doctor somersaults on to the horse's back and uses his sonic screwdriver to sever the traces and reins.)
CABBIE: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Forwards.
(He gallops off. Madam Vastra's carriage driven by Strax goes past the stranded cabbie.)
STRAX: Out of the way, human scum. Hi-yah. Jurassic emergency. Yah.
(The Doctor is cantering along the cobbles.)
DOCTOR: Left. No, no. Right, right, right, right. Sorry, it's my new hands. I can't tell them apart.

[Vastra's carriage]

JENNY: What do you think's happened?
VASTRA: I don't know, but I fear devilment.
CLARA: Should we not have told the Doctor?
JENNY: He's not ready to leave his bed.

[Street]

DOCTOR: Watch it on the corners, it's a bit slippery up here.

[Vastra's carriage]

VASTRA: Strax.
(Strax is urging on the horse.)
VASTRA: Come on, Strax.
(He cracks the whip.)
VASTRA: That's better.

[Westminster Bridge]

(The Doctor dismounts and stands on the parapet over the burning remains, muttering to himself.)
DOCTOR: (sotto) Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
(Strax brings the carriage to a halt behind him, and the ladies get out.)
STRAX: Whoa.
JENNY: The Doctor.
CLARA: What's he doing here?
(Vastra secures her carriage using the remote control in her hat.)
VASTRA: There is trouble. Where else would he be?
DOCTOR: She was scared. She was scared and alone. I brought her here and look what they did.
VASTRA: Who or what could have done this thing?
DOCTOR: No.
VASTRA: I'm sorry?
DOCTOR: No. That is not the question. That is not where we start.
STRAX: The question is how. The flesh itself has been combusted.
DOCTOR: No, no, shut up. What do you all have for brains, pudding? Look at you. Why can't I meet a decent species? Planet of the pudding brains.
CLARA: Doctor, I know you're upset, but you need to calm down and talk to us. What is the question?
DOCTOR: A dinosaur is burning in the heart of London. Nothing left but smoke and flame. The question is, have there been any similar murders?
VASTRA: Yes. Yes, by the Goddess, there have.
DOCTOR: Look at them all, gawking.
DOCTOR: Question two. If all the pudding brains are gawking, then what is he?
(One man is walking away calmly.)
VASTRA: He seems remarkably unmoved by the available spectacle.
CLARA: Do you think that is whoever
(There is a splash. The Doctor is no longer standing on the parapet.)
CLARA: What he's doing? He'll drown.
VASTRA: I very much doubt it.
CLARA: Why?
VASTRA: There has been a murder. The Doctor has taken up the case. If we are to see him again, we must do the same.

[Clara's bedroom]

(Next day. Clara pours water into a bowl on her washstand.)
STRAX [OC]: Come on, Earthling scum. Position it here. Easy now. That's it. Careful.
(She opens the window onto the courtyard. A cart has brought the Tardis from the river bank.)
STRAX: Don't get it scratched or you and all your bloodline will be obliterated from time and space.
FOOTMAN: Very good, sir.
(Clara leans out.)
CLARA: Strax!

[Courtyard]

STRAX: Ah! Morning, Miss Clara. You're awake at last.
CLARA: You got the Tardis, then?
STRAX: Military tactics. The Doctor is still missing, but he will always come looking for his box. By bringing it here, he will be lured from the dangers of London to this place of safety, and we will melt him with acid.
CLARA: Okay, that last part?
STRAX: And we will not melt him with acid. Old habits. The Times. Shall I send it up?
CLARA: Yeah, why not?
STRAX: Hah!
(He throws the rolled-up newspaper, hitting her squarely between the eyes and knocking her down.)

[Staircase]

(Clara is dressed and coiffured in the late Victorian style. She meets Jenny coming up the stairs.)
CLARA: Jenny.
JENNY: Ah, good morning, Clara.
CLARA: Morning. Er, so, what are we going to do? Are we looking for the Doctor?
JENNY: We've got the Paternoster Irregulars out in force. If anyone can find him, they can. Meanwhile, Madam Vastra is slightly occupied by the Conk-Singleton forgery case, and is having the Camberwell child poisoner for dinner.
CLARA: For dinner?
JENNY: After she's finished interrogating him. Probably best to stay out the larder. It'll get a bit noisy in there later.
CLARA: Oh.

[Kitchen]

(Strax is mopping the floor.)
STRAX: Ah, Miss Clara. You look better now you're up.
CLARA: Thank you, Strax.
STRAX: Oh, sorry. Trick of the light. You still look terrible. Can I get you anything?
CLARA: Er, no, thanks. Maybe just some water.
STRAX: Of course.
(He puts the mop bucket on the table.)
STRAX: Well, don't hold back. I've nearly finished anyway.
CLARA: Er.
STRAX: It's perfectly all right. I washed in it myself.
CLARA: All of a sudden, I'm not very thirsty.
STRAX: Really? Perhaps it is time, then.
(He takes out a monocle like device with three lenses, and shines a green light into her eye.)
STRAX: For your mandatory medical examination. Say ah.
CLARA: Ah.
STRAX: You didn't move your lips.
CLARA: You're looking at my eye.
STRAX: Oh. Oh yes, there we are. Easy mistake.
(He aims the light at her forehead.)
STRAX: Now that's interesting.
CLARA: What? What's interesting?
STRAX: Deflected narcissism. Traces of passive aggressive. And a lot of muscular young men doing sport.
CLARA: What are you looking at?
STRAX: Your subconscious. Is that sport? It could be sport.
(She flicks down the lens.)
CLARA: Well, stop looking.
STRAX: Moving onto the thorax, such as it is.
(The green light makes Clara's ribcage visible.)
STRAX: Ah, excellent. Enviable spleen. Well done. Twenty seven years old, with a projected lifespan of exactly
CLARA: Stop right there.
STRAX: Oh, you're going to do quite well. But watch out for fluid retention later. It's going to be spectacular. Well, put your clothes back on.
CLARA: They are on.
STRAX: Oh yes, so they are.
(She takes his scanner from him and puts it on the table.)
CLARA: Why are you doing this?
STRAX: If we are to serve together, I need you in peak physical prowess, eh?
(Strax punches Clara's arm.)
CLARA: Ow. Why would we be serving together? The Doctor's going to come back, isn't he?
STRAX: It is to be hoped.
CLARA: He's not just going to abandon me here.
STRAX: You must stop worrying about him, my boy. By now, he's almost certainly had his throat cut by the violent poor.

[Alleyway]

(Bermondsey, I'd say. Near the Clink and Southwark Cathedral. The Doctor, still in his now very dirty nightshirt, is rummaging in the rubbish. He is watched by a smelly tramp in a thick coat, who is holding a beer bottle. The Doctor finds a broken mirror. He turns at the sound of the tramp throwing away his bottle. For those who like trivia, the tramp is played by Elisabeth Sladen's widower.)
DOCTOR: Bitey. The air, it's bitey. It's wet, and bitey.
BARNEY: Oh, it's cold.
DOCTOR: That's right. It's cold. It's cold, I knew it was a thing. I need um, I need clothes. I need clothes, that's what I need. And a big, long scarf. No, no, move on from that. Looked stupid. Er, have you seen this face before?
BARNEY: No.
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
BARNEY: Sir, I have never seen that face.
DOCTOR: It's funny, because I'm sure that I have. You know, I never know where the faces come from. They just pop up. Zap. Faces like this one. Come on, look at it, have a look, come on, look, look, look.
(The Doctor pulls Barney over to look in the mirror on the ground.)
DOCTOR: Look, it's covered in lines. But I didn't do the frowning. Who frowned me this face? Do you ever look in the mirror and think I've seen that face before?
BARNEY: Yes.
DOCTOR: Really? When?
BARNEY: Well, every time I look in the mirror.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Fair enough. Good point. My face is fresh on, though.
BARNEY: Er
(Barney moves away from the nutter in the nightshirt.)
DOCTOR: Why this one? Why did I choose this face? It's like I'm trying to tell myself something. Like I'm trying to make a point. But what is so important that I can't just tell myself what I'm thinking?
BARNEY: Er
DOCTOR: I'm not just being rhetorical here. You can join in.
BARNEY: I don't like it.
DOCTOR: What?
BARNEY: Your face.
DOCTOR: Well, I don't like it either. Well, it's all right up until the eyebrows. Then it just goes haywire. Look at the eyebrows. These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these.
BARNEY: They are mighty eyebrows indeed, sir.
DOCTOR: They're cross. They're crosser than the rest of my face. They're independently cross. They probably want to secede from the rest of my face and set up their own independent state of eyebrows. That's Scot. I am Scottish. I've gone Scottish?
BARNEY: Oh yes, you are. You are definitely Scots, sir. I, I 'ear it in your voice.
DOCTOR: Oh no, that's good. Oh.
(He practices the long rolling Scottish 'oh' sound.)
DOCTOR: It's good I'm Scottish. I'm Scottish. I am Scottish. I can complain about things, I can really complain about things. Now, give me your coat.
BARNEY: No.
DOCTOR: I am cold.
BARNEY: I'm cold.
DOCTOR: I'm cold. There's no point in us both being cold. Give me your coat. Give me your coat. No, wait. Shut up, shut up. Shut up. I missed something. It was here, it was here. It was. What was it I saw? What did I see?
(He pick up an old newspaper.)
DOCTOR: This is what I saw. Spontaneous combustion.
(Fourth case of spontaneous combustion. The death of Margaret Roberts occurred on Friday, outside her home address in London, in what the police are describing as a curious case of spontaneous combustion. She was aged 68 years. Born in Scotland, Mrs Roberts etc, etc.)
BARNEY: What devilry is this, sir?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I probably blame the English.

[Vastra's chamber]

(Vastra is working at a large wood backed panel on an easel while Jenny holds an awkward pose in her corset and a shawl.)
VASTRA: Hmm. Spontaneous combustion.
JENNY: Is that like love at first sight?
VASTRA: Hmm. A little. It is the theory that human beings can, with little or no inducement, simply explode.
JENNY: You don't need to flirt with me. We're already married.
VASTRA: It's scientific nonsense, of course.
JENNY: Marriage?
VASTRA: Hush. There have been nine reported incidents of people apparently exploding in the last month.
JENNY: And you think they weren't spontaneous.
VASTRA: I think whoever killed the dinosaur had at least nine previous victims. All of these perished in the same spectacular fashion.
(Vastra turns the easel to reveal newspaper cuttings, a map of London, and lines linking them up.)
JENNY: I thought you were painting me.
VASTRA: I was working.
JENNY: Well, why am I posing then?
VASTRA: Well, you brighten the room tremendously. Chin up a little.
JENNY: Oh, I don't understand why I'm doing this.
VASTRA: Art? Now, why destroy the victims so completely? It's difficult, it draws attention. What advantage is to be gained?
JENNY: Well, tell us, then.
VASTRA: Concealment, perhaps.
JENNY: Concealment?
VASTRA: It's a fanciful theory, but it fits the facts. By destroying the body so completely, you conceal what is missing from it.
JENNY: Missing from the body?
CLARA [OC]: Madame Vastra!
(A happy Clara bursts into the room.)
VASTRA: Clara, excellent. Pop your clothes on that chair there.
CLARA: Look.
(Clara shows Vastra the Times newspaper.)
VASTRA: Advertisements, yes. So many. It's a distressing modern trend.
CLARA: No, look. Look.
(One advert in the personal column says - Impossible Girl. Lunch on the other side?)
JENNY: Ma'am?
VASTRA: The game is afoot. We're going to need a lot of tea.
(Vastra rings the bell. Later, Strax is pouring it out.)
VASTRA: There appears to be nothing of significance in the rest of the newspaper. Not even in the agony column.
JENNY: We can't know it's from the Doctor.
CLARA: Of course it's from the Doctor. The Impossible Girl, that's what he calls me.
VASTRA: He says lunch, but not when or where?
JENNY: On the other side? The other side of London? Bit vague.
VASTRA: The other side of regeneration, perhaps, once he's recovered?
CLARA: So what am I supposed to do, guess where we're meeting?
VASTRA: Perhaps that's the point. Perhaps you're supposed to prove that you still know him. Think what that must mean for a man who barely knows himself.
CLARA: It doesn't makes sense. He doesn't do puzzles. He isn't complicated. Really doesn't have the attention span. So, keeping it dead simple. On the other side.
(She hold the page up to the light. There is another advert directly behind hers, so she turns it over to read it. Mancini's Family Restaurant, the Best Dinner in London.)

[Mancini's]

(Clara crosses the street and looks up at the building, which is just as depicted in the advert. She goes inside and sits by herself on a curved bench seat in a wall alcove, with a small round table in front of it. The restaurant has other customers, but is very quiet. She examines the advert again, then sniffs. Then she coughs as she fans the air with the paper. Her companion is wearing a noisome coat.)
DOCTOR: What's wrong?
CLARA: I don't know. Maybe the smell?
DOCTOR: I know. It's everywhere.
CLARA: Where did you get that coat?
DOCTOR: Er, ahem, I bought it.
CLARA: From where?
DOCTOR: Er, a shop?
CLARA: No.
DOCTOR: Might have been a tramp.
CLARA: You don't have any money.
DOCTOR: Er, I had a watch.
CLARA: No. That watch was beautiful.
DOCTOR: It was my favourite.
CLARA: You swapped your favourite watch for that coat. That's maybe not a good deal.
DOCTOR: Well, I was in a hurry. There was a terrible smell.
CLARA: Okay.
(The Doctor smiles and laughs a little.)
CLARA: No. No, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't smile. I will smile first and then you know it's safe to smile.
DOCTOR: Are you cross with me?
CLARA: I am not cross. But if I was cross it would be your fault and. Yes, I am cross.
DOCTOR: I guessed that.
CLARA: I am extremely cross.
DOCTOR: And if I hadn't changed my face, would you be cross?
CLARA: I would be cross if I wasn't cross.
DOCTOR: Why?
CLARA: Why? An ordinary person wants to meet someone that they know very well for lunch. What do they do?
DOCTOR: Well, they probably get in touch and suggest lunch.
CLARA: Mmm hmm. Okay, so what sort of person would put a cryptic note in, in a newspaper advert?
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't like to say.
CLARA: Oh, go on, do say.
DOCTOR: Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, needy, game-player sort of person.
CLARA: Ah, thank you. Well, at least that hasn't changed.
DOCTOR: And I don't suppose it ever will.
CLARA: No, I don't suppose it will, either.
DOCTOR: Clara, honestly, I don't want you to change. It was no bother, really. I saw your advert, I figured it out. I'm happy to play your game.
CLARA: No. No, no. I didn't place the ad. You placed the ad.
DOCTOR: No, I didn't.
CLARA: Yes, you placed the ad, I figured it out. Impossible Girl, see? Lunch.
DOCTOR: No, look, the Impossible. That is a message from the Impossible Girl.
CLARA: For the Impossible Girl.
DOCTOR: Ooo.
CLARA: Oh.
DOCTOR: Well, if neither of us placed that ad, who placed that ad?
CLARA: Hang on. Egomaniac, needy, game-player?
DOCTOR: This could be a trap.
CLARA: That was me?
DOCTOR: Never mind that.
CLARA: Yes, I am minding that.
DOCTOR: Clara.
CLARA: You were talking about me?
DOCTOR: Clara, what is happening right now in this restaurant to you and me is more important than your egomania.
CLARA: Nothing is more important than my egomania.
DOCTOR: Right, you actually said that.
CLARA: You never mention that again.
DOCTOR: It's a vanity trap. You're so busy congratulating yourself on solving the puzzle, you don't notice that you're sticking your head in a noose.
CLARA: What are you doing?
(The Doctor pulls a hair from his head.)
CLARA: And that isn't the only grey one, if you are, er, having a cull.
DOCTOR: What, do you have a problem with the grey ones?
CLARA: If I got new hair and it was grey, I would have a problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I bet you would.
CLARA: Meaning?
DOCTOR: It's too short.
(He pulls a hair from Clara's head.)
CLARA: Ow.
DOCTOR: Sorry, it was the only one out of place. I'm sure that you would want it killed.
CLARA: Ooo. Are you trying to tell me something?
DOCTOR: I'm trying to measure the air disturbance in the room.
CLARA: Right. Moments when you know you are boring.
(He holds the hair below the table edge and lets it go. It falls slowly downwards.)
DOCTOR: There is something extremely wrong with everybody else in this room.
CLARA: Mmm. Basically, don't you always think that?
DOCTOR: Look at them. Don't look.
CLARA: You just said to look.
DOCTOR: Look without looking.
CLARA: They look fine to me. They're just eating.
DOCTOR: Are they?
(A soup spoon is repeatedly brought up to the mouth and lowered again, still full. Knifes and forks lift and fall over plates.)
CLARA: Okay, no. No, they're not eating.
DOCTOR: Something else they're not doing.
(Another short grey hair falls to the floor.)
DOCTOR: (sotto) Breathing.
CLARA: (sotto) What do we do?
DOCTOR: Well, you don't want to eat, do you?
CLARA: Hmm. Slightly lost my appetite. Ahem. How long before they notice that we're different?
DOCTOR: Not long.
CLARA: Anything we can do?
DOCTOR: How long can you hold your breath?
CLARA: We could just casually stroll out of here, like we've changed our minds.
DOCTOR: Happens all the time.
CLARA: Ha. Course it does.
(They stand. The other diners stop and stand with a clatter of clockwork. They take a step, the diners move towards them.)
CLARA: We could take another look at the menu.
(So they sit down again and the diners return to their tables.)
CLARA: What are they?
DOCTOR: I don't know. But don't worry, because that's not the question. The question is, what is this restaurant?
CLARA: Okay, what is this restaurant?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
(They look at the small menus. A waiter appears at their table.)
DOCTOR: Er, no sausages? Do you? And there's no pictures either. Do you have a children's menu?
(The waiter shines a small green light at the Doctor from the tip of his pencil.)
DOCTOR: Any specials?
WAITER: Liver.
DOCTOR: I don't like liver.
WAITER: Spleen. Brain stem. Eyes.
CLARA: Mmm. Is there a lot of demand for those?
DOCTOR: I don't think that's what's on the menu. I think we are the menu.
WAITER: Lungs. Skin.
DOCTOR: Excuse me.
(The Doctor reaches up and pulls off the waiter's face. There is a metal mesh beneath with a flame behind it.)
CLARA: Okay. Robot in a mask.
DOCTOR: It's a face.
CLARA: Yeah, it's very convincing.
(The Doctor puts it over Clara's face.)
DOCTOR: No, it's a face.
CLARA: Oh!
(She throws it down.)
WAITER: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yes, what?
WAITER: Yes, we have a children's menu.
(Metal arms come out of the back of the bench and hold them tightly around the arms and legs. They are very nice arms, with hands on the end to clasp together firmly. Then the bench descends.)
DOCTOR: You've got to admire their efficiency.
CLARA: Is it okay if I don't?
(They cry out as they go down.)

[Spaceship]

(A large steampunk circular place, all brass and rivets. There are various people standing still in small alcoves around the wall, and the half-face man is seated in a chair in the centre.)
DOCTOR: Hello? Hello, are you the manager? I demand to speak to the manager.
CLARA: This is not a real restaurant, is it?
DOCTOR: Well now, it's more a sort of automated organ collection station for the unwary diner. Sweeney Todd without the pies.
CLARA: So where are we now?
DOCTOR: Factually? An ancient spaceship, probably buried for centuries. Functionally? A larder.
CLARA: So why hasn't somebody come for us?
DOCTOR: We're alive.
CLARA: We're alive in a larder.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's cheaper than freezing us.
CLARA: Okay.
(The Doctor has shaken his sonic screwdriver out from under his coat.)
DOCTOR: Are you ready?
CLARA: Go for it.
DOCTOR: Don't let it roll away.
CLARA: No.
DOCTOR: We've got one shot at this.
CLARA: Next time, make one that doesn't roll.
DOCTOR: Go.
(The Doctor manages to shake the sonic screwdriver onto the floor near Clara's feet.)
DOCTOR: Have you got it?
CLARA: I can only just about reach it.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's at times like this I miss Amy.
CLARA: Who?
DOCTOR: Nothing.
(Clara gathers the screwdriver between her feet and aims upwards it at the Doctor.)
CLARA: Ready?
DOCTOR: Don't miss.
(She flicks it up into his lap. He winces.)
DOCTOR: Oh.
CLARA: Sorry, did I hit something?
DOCTOR: Oh, the symbolism.
(He gets the screwdriver into his hands and unfastens his bonds with it, then Clara's.)
CLARA: You should make that thing voice-activated. Oh, for God's sake, it is, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I don't want to talk about it.
CLARA: Doctor?
(There is a Chinaman in the nearest alcove.)
DOCTOR: Dormant.
CLARA: How do you know?
DOCTOR: I don't. I'm just hoping.
(They tiptoe away.)
CLARA: So, is it these guys that killed the dinosaur?
DOCTOR: Well, if they're harvesting organs, a dinosaur would have some great stuff.
CLARA: Why would robots need organs? Burke and Hare from space?
DOCTOR: No, but that's a good theory. Droids harvesting spare parts. That rings a bell.
(He stares at the Half-Face Man in the chair in the middle.)
DOCTOR: Captain, my Captain.
CLARA: Can he see us?
DOCTOR: Dormant.
CLARA: Hoping?
DOCTOR: Yep. Oh, look. He's recharging. He's asleep. Doesn't even know we're here.
CLARA: Are you sure?
DOCTOR: Sure. Not sure. One or the other.
CLARA: Okay. So, half-man, half-robot. A cyborg, yeah?
DOCTOR: Oh.
CLARA: Oh?
BOTH: Oh.
DOCTOR: Look at the hands.
CLARA: What about them?
DOCTOR: Look at them.
CLARA: I'm looking.
DOCTOR: They don't match. These hands don't belong to the same body.
(One is large and fleshy, a workman's hand. The other is slim and dainty, never scrubbed a floor in its life.)
CLARA: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Well, I don't blame you. See this, this is not your normal cyborg. This isn't a man turning himself into a robot. This is a robot turning himself into a man, piece by piece.
CLARA: That's what the restaurant's for.
DOCTOR: Well, it would need a constant supply of spare parts. You can tan skin, but organs rot. Some of that metalwork looks Roman. Wonder how long it's been around, how much of the original is even left? The eyeballs look very fresh, though.
(The arms move. They jump back.)
CLARA: Ah.
(It takes hold of the chair arms, and clockwork whirrs.)
CLARA: (sotto) Is it awake?
DOCTOR: It's waking up. I think. Okay, let's go.
(They tiptoe away, then run through a doorway into a brightly lit corridor. The Doctor turns back.)
DOCTOR: I've seen this before. I'm missing something.
CLARA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's the brand new head, rebooting.
CLARA: Come on.
DOCTOR: I've seen this before.
CLARA: Oh, hurry up. Get out.
(Clara returns and pushes the Doctor through the doorway as the Half-Face Man raises his arm and touches his palm. The door comes down between the Doctor and Clara. He tries to sonic it open.)
CLARA: Doctor. Quickly.
(The door lifts a short way. The Half-Face Man is unplugging himself from his chair.)
DOCTOR: Sorry, too slow. There's no point in them catching us both.
CLARA: Well, give me the screwdriver.
DOCTOR: I might need it.
(The Doctor closes the door fully and leaves her.)
CLARA: No. Doctor?
(The Half-Face Man goes to the bench seat, then turns and looks for its occupants. Clara tries standing very still in  a recess as the other occupants of the alcoves become active. One man opens the door and stands next to it.)
DOCTOR [memory]: Something else they're not doing. Breathing. How long can you hold your breath?
(Clara takes a deep breath and holds it as the Half-Face Man walks towards her. He stops and tilts his head as the gears grind, then turns away. A tear rolls down Clara's face. The other robots move, so she imitates their stilted walk and goes through the open door into the bright passageway. She runs around the corner but just sees more robots waiting and the passage going on and on. Her lungs are bursting, so she takes a breath and falls to her knees. She passes out.)
HALF-FACE MAN: Bring her.
(A bald robot picks her up. Clara dreams about her first day teaching at Coal Hill School. The class were completely out of control and laughing at her.)
CLARA [memory]: All right, stop. Stop. Stop it, all of you, now.
BOY [memory]: Ha, ha. It's her first day.
(Clara is laid on the ground in front of the Half-Face Man in his chair.)
CLARA [memory]: If you don't stop it, I'm going to have each and every single one of you kicked out of this school.
(A dark girl's face looms.)
COURTNEY [memory]: Go on, then. Do it.
(Clara wakes up.)
HALF-FACE MAN: Where is the other one? There was another. Where is he? Where is the other? You will tell us, or you will be destroyed.
CLARA: What did you say?
HALF-FACE MAN: You will tell us.
CLARA: Yeah, I know. Or what?
HALF-FACE MAN: You will die.
COURTNEY [memory]: Go on, then. Do it.
(Clara stands.)
CLARA: Go on, then. Do it. I'm not going to answer any of your questions, so you have to do it. You have to kill me. Threats don't work unless you deliver.
HALF-FACE MAN: You will tell us where the other one is.
CLARA: Nope.
HALF-FACE MAN: You will be destroyed.
CLARA: Destroy me, then. And if you don't, then I'm not going to believe a single threat you make from now on. Of course, if I'm dead, then I can't tell you where the other one went then. You need to keep this place down here a secret, don't you? Never start with your final sanction. You've got nowhere to go but backwards.
HALF-FACE MAN: Humans feel pain.
CLARA: Ah. Bigger threat to smaller threat. See what I mean? Backwards.
HALF-FACE MAN: The information can be extracted by means of your suffering.
CLARA: Are you trying to scare me? Well, cos I'm already bloody terrified of dying. And I'll endure a lot of pain for a very long time before I give up the information that's keeping me alive. How long have you got?
(The clockwork whirs, then the Half-Face Man stands up.)
CLARA: All you can offer me is my life. What you can't do is threaten it. You can negotiate.
(The Half-Face Man removes his big right hand and clamps it onto his lapel.)
CLARA: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, yes, yes, yes, I'm crying and it's just because I am very frightened of you. If you know anything about human beings, that means you, you're in a lot trouble.
(The robot has a flame-thrower where his hand was, ready to go.)
HALF-FACE MAN: We will not negotiate.
CLARA: You don't have a choice. I tell you what. I'll answer your questions if you answer mine.
HALF-FACE MAN: We will not answer questions.
CLARA: We'll take turns. I'll go first. Why did you kill the dinosaur?
HALF-FACE MAN: We will not answer questions.
CLARA: Why'd you kill the dinosaur?
HALF-FACE MAN: We will not answer questions!
CLARA: Then you might as well kill me, because I'm not talking again till you do.
HALF-FACE MAN: Within the optic nerve of the dinosaur is material of use to our computer systems.
CLARA: You burned a whole dinosaur for a spare part? No. No, hang on. You know what's in a dinosaur's optic nerve, which means you've seen them before.
HALF-FACE MAN: Where is the other one?
CLARA: How long have you been rebuilding yourselves? Look at the state of you. Is there any real you left? What's the point?
HALF-FACE MAN: We will reach the promised land.
CLARA: The what? The promised land? What's that?
HALF-FACE MAN: Where is the other one?
CLARA: I don't know. But I know where he will be. Where he will always be. If the Doctor is still the Doctor, he will have my back.
Clara reaches behind her.)
CLARA: I'm right, aren't I? Go on. Please, please, go on, say I'm right.
(A hand grabs hers and pulls her back. Then the bald robot removes the skin from his face.)
DOCTOR: Ah. Hello, hello, rubbish robots from the dawn of time. Thank you for all the gratuitous information. Five foot one and crying. You never stood a chance. Stop it.
(The Doctor pulls the flame-thrower arm down and puts his sonic screwdriver into the recharger in the chair. The lights go out.)
DOCTOR: This is your power source. And feeble though it is, I can use it to blow this whole room if I see one thing that I don't like. And that includes karaoke and mime, so take no chances. See, Clara? That's how you disguise yourself as a droid.
CLARA: Yeah, well, I didn't have a lot of time. I'd been suddenly abandoned.
DOCTOR: Yeah, sorry. Well no, actually, I'm not. You're brilliant on adrenaline. And you were out of your depth, sir. Never try and control a control freak.
CLARA: I am not a control freak!
DOCTOR: Yes, ma'am.
CLARA: Oh.
HALF-FACE MAN: Why are you here?
DOCTOR: Why did you invite us? The message, in the paper. That was you, wasn't it? Oh.
(He takes back his screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: I hate being wrong in public. Everybody forget that happened. Clara, say the word.
CLARA: What word?
DOCTOR: They never sent you in here without a word.
CLARA: I don't want to say it.
DOCTOR: I've guessed already.
(Clara touches her top button, which glows bright blue.)
BOTH: Geronimo.
(Two ladies in tight leather catsuits descend from the ceiling by means of long pieces of fabric wrapped around their waists, then pull large swords from the scabbard on their backs.)
VASTRA: Remain still, and lay down your weapons in the name of the British Empire.
STRAX: Argh.
(Their short but robust companion didn't have fabric long enough. He just falls to the floor with his honking great gun.)
VASTRA: Strax.
STRAX: Sorry.
JENNY: I've told you before. Take the stairs.
DOCTOR: Oh, look. The cavalry.
HALF-FACE MAN: I burned an ancient, beautiful creature for one inch of optic nerve. What do you think you can accomplish, little man?
DOCTOR: What do you? Vastra?
(Vastra blocks the flame-thrower with her sword.)
VASTRA: The establishment upstairs has been disabled with maximum prejudice, and the authorities summoned.
CLARA: Hang on, she called the police? We never do that. We should start.
DOCTOR: You see? Destroy us if you will, they're still going to close your restaurant. That was going to sound better.
HALF-FACE MAN: Then we will destroy you.
(All the robots have swords for arms.)
DOCTOR: No, you won't. You're logical. You have restraint. You killed to survive. You're not a murderer.
CLARA: He's not a what? This is a slaughterhouse.
DOCTOR: And how does that make it different from any other restaurant? You weren't vegetarian the last time I checked. This is over. Killing us won't change that. What would be the point?
HALF-FACE MAN: To find the promised land.
DOCTOR: You're millions of years old. It's time you knew, there isn't one.
HALF-FACE MAN: I am in search of paradise.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, me too. I'm not going to make it either.
(The Half-Face Man knocks the Doctor down.)
CLARA: Doctor!
HALF-FACE MAN: I will leave in the escape capsule. Destroy where necessary.
VASTRA: Escape capsule? This ship is millions of years old. It'll never fly.
HALF-FACE MAN: It has been repaired.
CLARA: What with?
HALF-FACE MAN: You.
STRAX: Defensive positions, everyone.
CLARA: Doctor. He's getting away.
(The Half-Face Man goes up on the bench seat while the rest of the robots encircle our heroes.)
HALF-FACE MAN: Your friend is intelligent. He'll know better than to follow me.
(The Doctor is holding on to a convenient brass handle on the underside of the seat.)

[Outside Mancini's]

(Gregson has brought two uniformed policemen with him.)
GREGSON: Right, here we are. This is the place. Come with me.
(He goes inside.)

[Spaceship]

VASTRA: It is our intent to leave. If it is your intent to stop us, perhaps we should get down to business.

[Mancini's]

(Overturned tables and deactivated robots.)
GREGSON: Dear Lord, what has she landed us with this time?
(The Half-Face Man arrives on the bench seat and stands up.)
HALF-FACE MAN: The restaurant is closed.

[Outside Mancini's]

GREGSON: Keep everyone out. No one goes in there.

[Mancini's]

(The Doctor pours two glasses of whiskey.)
HALF-FACE MAN: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: I've got the horrible feeling I'm going to have to kill you. I thought you might appreciate a drink first. I know I would.
(The Half-Face Man turns back to the control panel in the wall and pulls down a small lever. There is a grinding sound.)

[Outside Mancini's]

(The roof opens.)
GREGSON: Watch out.

[Mancini's]

DOCTOR: Fifty first century, right? Time travelling spaceship crashed in the past. You're trying to get home the long way round.
HALF-FACE MAN: I go to the promised land.
DOCTOR: So you keep saying. Okay, so your restaurant is made out of your old ship. But you're wasting your time. It can't ever fly.
(The Doctor picks up a posy that had been on a table.)
HALF-FACE MAN: The escape pod is viable.
DOCTOR: How? You can't patch up a spaceship with human remains. You know, this really is ringing a bell.
(The room shakes.)
DOCTOR: Okay, that's clever. How are you powering it?
HALF-FACE MAN: Skin.

[Outside Mancini's]

(A giant pink balloon rises out of the building.)
GREGSON: Get to the station. We need more men.
POLICEMAN: What shall I tell them is happening?
GREGSON: Go!

[Spaceship]

VASTRA: How many do you estimate, my dear?
JENNY: More than upstairs. About twenty, thirty?
VASTRA: The ones upstairs were mere decoys. These are battle ready. I anticipate a challenge.
STRAX: Don't worry, my boy, we shall die in glory.
CLARA: Okay. Good-o.

[Mancini's]

(The escape pod is the main room of the restaurant, carried aloft by the pink balloon. The Doctor removes a fuse from the board and reads the inscription.)
DOCTOR: SS Marie Antoinette. Out of control repair droids cannibalising human beings. I know that this is familiar, but I just can't seem to place it.
HALF-FACE MAN: How would you kill me?
DOCTOR: Sister ship of the Madame De Pompadour. No, not getting it.
(He sniffs the posy then throws it aside.)
HALF-FACE MAN: How would you kill me?
DOCTOR: Why don't you have a drink first? It's only human.
HALF-FACE MAN: I am not human.
DOCTOR: Neither am I.

[Spaceship]

STRAX: Why can't you stay dead, coward?
(The robots keep getting back up.)

[Mancini's]

(The balloon and its gondola float over Saint Pauls Cathedral.)
DOCTOR: What do you think of the view?
HALF-FACE MAN: I do not think of it.
DOCTOR: I don't think of it. I don't. Droids and apostrophes, I could write a book. Except you are barely a droid any more. There's more human in you than machine. So tell me, what do you think of the view?
(The Half-Face Man gets up and draws back the net curtain. They are heading towards Westminster.)
HALF-FACE MAN: It is beautiful.
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It's just far away. Everything looks too small. I prefer it down there. Everything is huge. Everything is so important. Every detail, every moment, every life clung to.
HALF-FACE MAN: How could you kill me?
DOCTOR: For the same reason that you're asking me that question, because you don't really want to carry on. What'll happen to the other droids when you die? You're the control node, aren't you? Presumably they'll deactivate.
HALF-FACE MAN: I will not die. I will reach the promised land.
DOCTOR: There isn't any promised land. This is just. It's a superstition that you have picked up from all the humanity you've stuffed inside yourself.
HALF-FACE MAN: I am not dead.
DOCTOR: You are a broom. Question. You take a broom, you replace the handle, and then later you replace the brush, and you do that over and over again. Is it still the same broom? Answer? No, of course it isn't. But you can still sweep the floor. Which is not strictly relevant, skip that last part. You have replaced every piece of yourself, mechanical and organic, time and time again. There's not a trace of the original you left. You probably can't even remember where you got that face from.
(The Doctor holds up a silver plate between himself and the Half-Face Man. The droid takes it, looks carefully, then drops it.)
HALF-FACE MAN: It cannot end.
DOCTOR: It has to. You know it does. And there's only one way out.
(The Doctor opens the doors.)
HALF-FACE MAN: Self-destruction is against my basic programme.
DOCTOR: And murder is against mine.
(They struggle in the doorway.)

[Spaceship]

(The women's arms are held firmly by the droids, and Vastra's sword is forced from her hands.)
VASTRA: Jenny!
(Sword points are at everyone's throats.)
CLARA: Hold your breath. They're stupid. Everybody hold their breath.
(They do. The droids pause then lower their weapons. Clara picks up the sonic screwdriver and crawls through the droid's legs on her hands and knees.)
VASTRA [OC]: Be brave, my love. I can store oxygen in my lungs. Share with me.
(Vastra and Jenny lock lips. Clara sonicks the door.)

[Mancini's]

HALF-FACE MAN: You are stronger than you look.
DOCTOR: And I'm hoping you are too. This is over. Are you capable of admitting that?
HALF-FACE MAN: Do you have it in you to murder me?
DOCTOR: Those people down there. They're never small to me. Don't make assumptions about how far I will go to protect them, because I've already come a very long way. And unlike you, I don't expect to reach the promised land.
(The Half-Face Man turns off his flame thrower. They release each other.)
DOCTOR: You realise, of course, one of us is lying about our basic programming.
HALF-FACE MAN: Yes.
DOCTOR: And I think we both know who that is.

[Spaceship]

(Strax is about to fire his weapon before he passes out.)
VASTRA: Stop.
(They all breathe. Clara can't get the screwdriver to work for her. As the sword tips are about to pierce their skin, the droids suddenly bend forward at the waist, deactivated. Clara and Jenny faint. A top hat falls past a giant clock face at twenty five past one. A droid is impaled on the cross at the top of the tower. The Doctor looks straight at us.)

[Courtyard]

(Strax drives the women home in the carriage.)
STRAX: Whoa.
JENNY: You're sure he'd come back here?
VASTRA: There's no trace of him in the wreckage. They searched all Parliament Hill. Where else would he go?
(There is a square space in the straw where the Tardis had been stood.)
VASTRA: I fear we have missed him.

[Vastra's chamber]

VASTRA: Please come in.
(Clara is back in her mini-kilt.)
CLARA: I'm not interrupting?
VASTRA: I should be glad of your company. What can I do for you?
CLARA: Ah, well, that's exactly what I was going to ask you. Seems like I'm stuck here now. Got a vacancy?
VASTRA: You would be very welcome to join our little household, but I have it on the highest authority that the Doctor will be returning for you very soon.
CLARA: Whose authority?
VASTRA: Well, the person who knows him best in all the universe.
CLARA: And who's that?
VASTRA: Miss Clara Oswald. Who perhaps has, by instinct, already dressed to leave.
CLARA: I just wanted a change of clothes. I don't think I know who the Doctor is any more.
(They hear the sound of an ancient set of time rotors outside.)
VASTRA: It would seem, my dear, you are very wrong about that. Clara? Give him hell. He'll always need it.

[Tardis]

(The dinosaur sputum has gone from the outside.)
CLARA: You've redecorated.
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: I don't like it.
(The spirit of Patrick Troughton lives on. I like it. Nice straight-forward console, a frieze of roundels on the wall and a high-backed chair for the Doctor. There is even a bookcase.)
DOCTOR: Not completely entirely convinced myself. I think there should be more round things on the walls. I used to have lots of round things. I wonder where I put them? I'm the Doctor. I've lived for over two thousand years, and not all of them were good. I've made many mistakes, and it's about time that I did something about that. Clara, I'm not your boyfriend.
CLARA: I never thought you were.
DOCTOR: I never said it was your mistake.
(He sets the Tardis flying then shows off the red silk lining of his dark blue Crombie coat. Those trousers are a tad too skinny for my taste, especially with the chunky Doc Marten shoes.)
DOCTOR: What do you think?
CLARA: Who put that advert in the paper?
DOCTOR: Who gave you my number? A long time ago, remember? You were given the number of a computer helpline, and you ended up phoning the Tardis. Who gave you that number?
CLARA: The woman. The woman in the shop.
DOCTOR: Then there's a woman out there who's very keen that we stay together.
(The Tardis lands. Sadly, the time rotor does not go up and down.)
DOCTOR: How do you feel on the subject?
CLARA: Am I home?
DOCTOR: If you want to be.
CLARA: I'm sorry. I'm, I'm so, so sorry. But I don't think I know who you are any more.
(Her mobile phone rings.)
DOCTOR: You'd better get that. It might be your boyfriend.
CLARA: Shut up. I don't have a boyfriend.
(Clara goes outside to answer the call.)

[City street]

CLARA: Hello? Hello?
DOCTOR 11 [OC]: It's me.
CLARA: Yes, it's you. Who's this?
DOCTOR 11 [OC]: It's me, Clara. The Doctor.
CLARA: What do you mean, the Doctor?

[Trenzalore / City street]

DOCTOR 11: I'm phoning you from Trenzalore.
CLARA: I don't
DOCTOR 11: From before I changed. I mean it's all still to happen for me. It's coming. Oh, it's a-coming.
(Back then, Clara replaced the Tardis police phone back on its hook.)
DOCTOR 11: Not long now. I can feel it.
CLARA: Why? Why would you do this?
DOCTOR 11: Because I think it's going to be a whopper, and I think you might be scared. And however scared you are, Clara, the man you are with right now, the man I hope you are with, believe me, he is more scared than anything you can imagine right now and he, he needs you.
DOCTOR: So who is it?
DOCTOR 11: Is that the Doctor?
DOCTOR: Is that the Doctor?
CLARA: Yes.
DOCTOR 11: He sounds old. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young. Oh, is he grey?
CLARA: Yes.
DOCTOR 11: Clara, please, hey, for me, help him. Go on. And don't be afraid. Goodbye, Clara. Miss ya.

[City street]

(Clara is sniffling.)
DOCTOR: Well?
CLARA: Well what?
DOCTOR: He asked you a question. Will you help me?
CLARA: You shouldn't have been listening.
DOCTOR: I wasn't. I didn't need to. That was me talking. You can't see me, can you? You look at me, and you can't see me. Have you any idea what that's like? I'm not on the phone, I'm right here, standing in front of you. Please, just, just see me.
(Clara walks forward and studies his face carefully. Then she smiles a little.)
CLARA: Thank you.
DOCTOR: For what?
CLARA: Phoning.
(She throws her arms around his neck.)
DOCTOR: I, I don't think that I'm a hugging person now.
CLARA: I'm not sure you get a vote.
DOCTOR: Whatever you say.
CLARA: This isn't my home, by the way.
(She lets go.)
DOCTOR: Sorry. I'm sorry about that. I missed.
CLARA: Where are we?
DOCTOR: Glasgow, I think.
CLARA: Ah. You'll fit right in. (Scots) Scottish.
DOCTOR: Right. Shall we, er. Do you want to go and get some coffee, or chips, or something? Or chips and coffee?
CLARA: Coffee. Coffee would be great. You're buying.
DOCTOR: I don't have any money.
CLARA: You're fetching, then.
DOCTOR: I'm not sure that I'm the fetching sort.
CLARA: Yeah, still not sure you get a vote.

[Garden]

(The Half-Face man wakes in a place looking very like the Pompeian Garden at Dyffren House, also used in the Sarah Jane Adventure, The Eternity Trap. The wisteria is in full bloom. He puts on his top hat. A woman in Edwardian costume is sitting on the edge of the fountain. She is the Gatekeeper of the Nethersphere, according to the BBC's own Doctor Who Blog.)
MISSY: Hello. I'm Missy. You made it. I hope my boyfriend wasn't too mean to you.
HALF-FACE MAN: Boy friend?
MISSY: Now, did he push you out of that thing, or did you fall? Couldn't really tell. He can be very mean sometimes. Except to me, of course, because he loves me so much. I do like his new accent, though. Think I might keep it.
HALF-FACE MAN: Where am I?
MISSY: Where do you think you are? Look around you. You made it. The promised land. Paradise. Welcome to heaven.
(She snaps her teeth together and dances around the water feature.)
[Fighter]

(A small space fighter is dodging weapons fire and asteroids. It's female pilot has an injured co-pilot.)
JOURNEY: Aristotle, this is Wasp Delta, do you hear me? Stay with me, Kai. Stay with me, please. Aristotle! We have been hit. Major damage. Aristotle!
(Her enemy is a massive flying saucer.)
JOURNEY: Aristotle! The enemy are right on top of us.
(The fighter is hit.)
JOURNEY: I'm sorry.

[Saucer]

DALEK: Exterminate.
(A second laser pulse finds its mark. The little fighter explodes as Journey screams.)

[Tardis]

(Journey opens her eyes to see the brass handles of the console. She sees the Doctor and scrambles for her hand gun, and keeps it pointing at him.)
DOCTOR: You'll probably feel a bit sick. Please, don't be.
(The Doctor is holding a card tray with two takeaway coffees in it.)
JOURNEY: Where's my brother?
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor.
JOURNEY: He was right beside me. Where's Kai? How did I get here?
DOCTOR: I materialised a time capsule exactly round you and saved your life one second before your ship exploded, but do please keep crying.
JOURNEY: My brother's just died.
DOCTOR: His sister didn't. You're very welcome. Put the gun down.
JOURNEY: Or what?
DOCTOR: Or you might shoot me. Then where will you be?
JOURNEY: In charge of your vessel.
DOCTOR: You'd starve to death trying to find the light switch. Who are you?
JOURNEY: I'm Lieutenant Journey Blue of the Combined Galactic Resistance. I demand you take me back to my command ship, the Aristotle, which is currently located
DOCTOR: No. Hey, not like that.
JOURNEY: You will take me back to my command ship, which is currently positioned
DOCTOR: No, no. Come on. Not like that. Not like that. Get it right
(Journey lowers her gun.)
JOURNEY: Will you take me back to my ship? Please?
DOCTOR: The Aristotle's the big fella parked in the asteroid belt, yeah?
(The Doctor sets the Tardis moving.)
JOURNEY: It's shielded.
DOCTOR: More or less.
(The Aristotle is hiding by one edge of a long thin asteroid. Journey opens the Tardis door.)
DOCTOR: Dry your eyes, Journey Blue. Crying's for civilians. It's how we communicate with you lot.

[Med Sec 07]

(The Tardis has neatly parked herself in a corner of a large section. There are pieces of metal debris and a soldier is driving a small buggy in the background.)
JOURNEY: It's smaller on the outside.
DOCTOR: It's a bit more exciting when you go the other way. This isn't a battleship. Medical insignia. It's a hospital.
(An older man with a greying beard speaks. He is backed up by armed soldiers.)
MORGAN: We don't need hospitals now. The Daleks don't leave any wounded, and we don't take any prisoners.
DOCTOR: I saved your little friend here, if that's in any way relevant to mention.
JOURNEY: That's true, sir. He did.
MORGAN: Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. I wish I could've done more.
MORGAN: Then you should have.
DOCTOR: Okay.
MORGAN: But you did save Journey, and for that I am personally grateful.
DOCTOR: Well
MORGAN: However, the security of this base is absolute. So we're still going to kill you.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a roller coaster with you, isn't it?
MORGAN: Shoot him, bag him and throw him outside.
JOURNEY: No! Stop!
MORGAN: I'm sorry. He might be a duplicate.
JOURNEY: He's a doctor. And we have a patient, don't we, Uncle?

[Corridor]

DOCTOR: Why does a hospital need a doctor?
MORGAN: The Aristotle wasn't always hidden. The Daleks got here before us.
JOURNEY: You don't like soldiers much, do you?
DOCTOR: You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns.

[Lab 01]

(The soldiers stand guard at door 078.)
DOCTOR: Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler.
(A large clear tube with bench seats down the inside. A bit like a decompression chamber for divers.)
JOURNEY: You know what it does, then?
DOCTOR: It miniaturises living matter. What's the medical application, though? Do you use it to shrink the surgeons so they can climb inside the patients?
MORGAN: Exactly.
DOCTOR: Fantastic idea for a movie. Terrible idea for a proctologist. Are you going to miniaturise me?
MORGAN: You're a doctor, aren't you?
(He opens a pair of secure doors further along.)
MORGAN: And this is your patient.
(A scratched eyepiece glows blue.)
DOCTOR: No, you don't understand. You can't put me in there.
RUSTY: Doctor?
(This is a battered 2005 style Dalek with various cables going into its dome.)

[Coal Hill school playground]
(A short haired, dark-skinned man with a neatly trimmed short beard shouts in the playground.)
DANNY: Atten-shun. Look at you lot. I've never seen such a miserable bunch. What are you, children?
FLEMING: Yes, sir.
(Danny and his troop are wearing matching t-shirts.)
DANNY: You think you're funny, Fleming?
FLEMING: Yes, sir.
DANNY: All right, me too.
(The school bell rings.)
DANNY: Dismissed.
(The members of the Coal Hill Cadet Corps run off to the school building.)
BOY: What you doing, Fleming?
(Clara smiles at Danny and follows the children inside.)

[Secretary's office]

(A little later, Danny enters, now dressed in shirt and tie, to check the timetable on the notice board for any changes.)
SECRETARY: So, Mister Pink, did you have a good weekend?
DANNY: Yeah, I did, thanks.
SECRETARY: Yeah, I'll bet you did. What did you get up to?
DANNY: Er, you know. A bit of reading.
SECRETARY: Oh, I bet you were reading.
DANNY: I was, yeah.
SECRETARY: Yeah, I bet you were.
DANNY: Well, yeah, I was.
SECRETARY: I know your type.
(A schoolgirl is listening at the public counter.)
COURTNEY: She wishes.
SECRETARY: Be quiet, you.

[Maths classroom]

DANNY: So that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Any questions?
FLEMING: Sir? Have you ever killed a man?
(Groans from the rest of the class.)
DANNY: I was a soldier. There were other soldiers and some of them weren't on our side. I shall leave the rest to your imagination. And, please, think of another question?
FLEMING: Okay. Have you ever killed anyone who wasn't a soldier?
DANNY: Just to repeat, that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Is everyone clear?
CLASS: Yes, sir.
(The class watch a lone tear roll down Danny's cheek.)

[Staff room]

(The staff are putting on their coats to leave. Clara is discussing timetables with the headmaster.)
CLARA: Fine, I'll take that class and then, they can do some of the test.
ARMITAGE: I know. Oh, Clara, you've not met Danny Pink yet? New fella, maths. Danny? Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Hey.
ARMITAGE: English.
DANNY: Hey, nice to meet you.
CLARA: You too.
ARMITAGE: Want to watch yourself around him. Bit of a lady-killer, but always denies it.
DANNY: I am not a lady-killer.
ARMITAGE: See what I mean? Oh, Beth, can I have a word?
BETH [OC]: Yeah, yeah, sure.
CLARA: Er, was it you that I saw outside doing the soldiery thing?
DANNY: Ah yeah, probably. The Coal Hill Cadets. Just a bit of fun.
CLARA: What, teaching them how to shoot people?
DANNY: There's a bit more to modern soldiering than just shooting people. I like to think there's a moral dimension.
CLARA: Ah, you shoot people then cry about it afterwards?
DANNY: Ah.
CLARA: Something wrong?
DANNY: Nothing, no. Sorry, no, nothing. I just. I didn't think they'd say anything, that's all.
CLARA: Sorry?
DANNY: Have they told everyone?
CLARA: No, no, no. As far as I know, nobody has told anybody anything. What are you talking about?
DANNY: Why did you just say the crying thing?
CLARA: I was being funny.
DANNY: Why?
CLARA: I just do that.
DANNY: Why?
CLARA: I don't know.
DANNY: Anyway I, er, I've left some stuff in my class.
CLARA: Okay, see you.
DANNY: See you.
CLARA: Er, are you going to the, er, leaving thing tonight for Cathy?
DANNY: Um.

[Maths classroom]

DANNY: Yeah. I wasn't going, but I am now, because you're going to be there, and suddenly it seems like the best idea ever.

[Staff room]

DANNY: No, I'm not.
CLARA: Oh, okay, never mind.
DANNY: Good night.
CLARA: Change your mind.
DANNY: Excuse me?
CLARA: I'm going. Er, I'll give you a lift. Why not? 

[Maths classroom]

DANNY: Actually, now that you mention it, seems like the best plan ever. Thank you.

[Staff room]

DANNY: No, I've got some reading.
CLARA: Ah, okay. Maybe some other time, then?

[Maths classroom]

DANNY: Thank you!
(He bangs his forehead on his desk.)
CLARA: Ahem. Is the wooden sound you or or the desk?
DANNY: How long have you been there?
CLARA: Longer than you would like.
DANNY: Okay.
CLARA: Are you going to look that terrified when you take me out for a drink?
DANNY: I, I absolutely promise I won't.
CLARA: Play your cards right and you might.

[Supply cupboard]

(Clara enters, and nearly walks into the tray of coffees that the Doctor is holding out to her. The Tardis just fits the width of the back of the cupboard.)
CLARA: Where the hell have you been?
DOCTOR: You sent me for coffee.
CLARA: Three weeks ago. In Glasgow.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, that's a long time.
CLARA: In Glasgow. That's dead in a ditch.
DOCTOR: It's not my fault, I got distracted.
CLARA: By what?
DOCTOR: You can always find something. Come on.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Why were you smiling?
CLARA: Was I? No, I wasn't.
DOCTOR: You were smiling at nothing. I'd almost say you were in love, but to be honest
CLARA: Honest?
DOCTOR: You're not a young woman any more.
CLARA: Yes, I am.
(Clara takes the coffees and puts them on the console.)
DOCTOR: Well, you don't look it.
CLARA: I do look it.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's right, keep your spirits up, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. I need something from you. I need the truth.
CLARA: Okay. Right, what is it? What's
(They sit on the console steps.)
CLARA: You're scared.
DOCTOR: I'm terrified.
CLARA: Of what?
DOCTOR: The answer to my next question, which must be honest and cold and considered, without kindness or restraint. Clara, be my pal and tell me, am I a good man?
CLARA: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Neither do I.
(He gets up and goes to the console.)
CLARA: Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans.
DOCTOR: I need you.
CLARA: Right. Where are we going?
(He starts the Tardis flying.)
DOCTOR: Into darkness.

[Rusty's room]

RUSTY: Doctor.
DOCTOR: How do you know who I am?
MORGAN: He doesn't. We promised him medical assistance.
RUSTY: Are you my doctor?
JOURNEY: We found it floating in space.
MORGAN: We thought it was deactivated, so we tried to disassemble it.
DOCTOR: You didn't realise there was a living creature inside.
JOURNEY: Not till it started screaming.
RUSTY: Help me.
DOCTOR: Why would I do that? Why would any living creature help you?
RUSTY: Daleks will die.
DOCTOR: Die all you like. Not my problem.
RUSTY: Daleks must be destroyed.
DOCTOR: Daleks must be de. What did you just say?
RUSTY: All Daleks must die. I will destroy the Daleks. Destroy the Daleks. Destroy the Daleks!

[Tardis]

(Drinking her coffee.)
CLARA: A good Dalek?
DOCTOR: There's no such thing.
CLARA: That's a bit inflexible. Not like you. I'd almost say prejudiced.
DOCTOR: (sigh) Do I pay you? I should give you a raise.
(The Tardis lands.)
CLARA: You're not my boss, you're one of my hobbies.
DOCTOR: Come on.

[Lab 01]

JOURNEY: That was quick.
DOCTOR: This is gun girl. She's got a gun, and she's a girl. This is a sort of boss one. Are you the same one as before?
MORGAN: Yes.
DOCTOR: I think he's probably her uncle, but I may have made that up to pass the time while they were talking. This is Clara, not my assistant. She's, er, some other word.
CLARA: I'm his carer.
DOCTOR: Yeah, my carer. She cares so I don't have to.

[Rusty's room]

RUSTY: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hello again.
RUSTY: Will you help me?
CLARA: Will you?
DOCTOR: A Dalek so damaged, it's turned good. Morality as malfunction. How do I resist?
RUSTY: Daleks must die. Daleks must die.
CLARA: So, what do we do with a moral Dalek, then?
DOCTOR: We get into its head.
CLARA: Mmm. How do you get into a Dalek's head?
DOCTOR: That wasn't a metaphor. 

[Lab 01]

(They go to the moleculon nanoscaler.)
JOURNEY: These are nanocontrollers. Once we're miniaturised, they take over the molecular compression. When the mission's over, hit the button.
(Journey puts the bracelet on Clara's wrist.)
JOURNEY: Are you sure you understand?
CLARA: Why wouldn't I?
JOURNEY: Because this is a dangerous mission and you look like a school teacher.
CLARA: I am a school teacher. Still didn't catch your name.
JOURNEY: Journey Blue.
CLARA: Blue?
JOURNEY: Blue, yes. Problem?
CLARA: No. Er, I just met a soldier called Pink.
JOURNEY: Lucky fella.
CLARA: Lucky?
JOURNEY: From the way you smile.
CLARA: So, er, who makes you smile or is nobody up to the job?
JOURNEY: My brother. But he burned to death a couple of hours ago, so he's really letting me down today. Excuse me.
DOCTOR: What are those ones for? I don't need armed baby-sitters.
GRETCHEN: We're not baby-sitters.
ROSS: We're here to shoot you dead if you turn out to be a Dalek spy.
DOCTOR: Well, that's a relief. I hate baby-sitters.
JOURNEY: Okay, listen up. Now, remember, do not hold your breath when the nanoscaler engages. You'll feel like you want to, but you must keep breathing normally during the miniaturisation process.
CLARA: Why?
DOCTOR: Ever microwaved a lasagne without pricking the film on top?
CLARA: It explodes.
DOCTOR: Don't be lasagne.
MORGAN: Nanoscaler engaging in five four three two. Nanoscaler engaging now. 
COMPUTER: Nanoscaling in progress.
(A crossbeam passes back and forth over chamber id AR-O13-AR-F74 until it shrinks with a bump.)
COMPUTER: Nanoscaling complete.
MORGAN: Nanoscaling successful. Everyone okay in there?
(The chamber is carefully picked up with a pair of tweezers.)
JOURNEY [OC]: We made it.

[Nanoscaler]

JOURNEY: Nobody popped.
CLARA: Whoa. Ha. I can't believe this.
DOCTOR: No, neither can I.
(The chamber is injected into Rusty's eye-piece. The Doctor reaches out and the surface wibbles.)

[Lab 01]

MORGAN: We'll be following you all the way, Rescue One. Good luck all of you.
(The Doctor's arm distorts as he slowly reaches into the blue 'eye' on the end of the stalk. Then they all push their way through.)
COMPUTER: Integration complete. Dalek levels steady.

[Eye stalk]

CLARA: That was weird.
DOCTOR: You've seen nothing yet.
CLARA: What are the lights?
DOCTOR: Visual impulses travelling towards the brain.
CLARA: Beautiful.
DOCTOR: Welcome to the most dangerous place in the universe.

[Lab 01]

(The computer is monitoring their locations inside Rusty.)
JOURNEY [OC]: Entering the cranial ledge now.

[Cranial ledge]

JOURNEY: Here.
CLARA: Oh, my God.
(They look down from the ledge onto the red tentacled blob that is the organic part of Rusty. Should really be green, but times have obviously changed. Cables run down into it.)
DOCTOR: Behold, the belly of the beast.
CLARA: It's amazing.
ROSS: It's huge.
GRETCHEN: No, Ross. We're tiny.
CLARA: So how big is it, that living part, compared to me and you, right now?
DOCTOR: You see all those cables?
CLARA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They're not all cables.
ROSS: Does it know we're here?
JOURNEY: It's what invited us in.
(The Doctor looks at banks of vertical lights around the inside of part of the ledge.)
DOCTOR: Now, this is the cortex vault, a supplementary electronic brain. Memory banks, but more than that. This is what keeps the Dalek pure.
GRETCHEN: How are Daleks pure?
DOCTOR: Dalek mutants are born hating. This is what stokes the fire, extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of kindness or compassion. Imagine the worst possible thing in the universe, then don't bother, because you're looking at it right now. This is evil refined as engineering.
RUSTY [OC]: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, hello, Rusty. You don't mind if I call you Rusty? We're going to need to come down there with you. Medical examination, and all that.
GRETCHEN: What, with those tentacles and things?
JOURNEY: How close do we have to get?
DOCTOR: Well, you know, we're never going to insert a thermometer from up here.
(Journey nods, and Ross fires a harpoon into Rusty's ledge. It hurts him. )
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no! Stop, stop, stop, you idiot!
(Another harpoon goes in.)
JOURNEY: We need a way down, the only way
DOCTOR: This is a Dalek, not a machine. It's a perfect analogue of a living being, and you just hurt it. So what's going to happen now?
CLARA: Oh, God.
GRETCHEN: What? What is it?
CLARA: Antibodies?
DOCTOR: Dalek antibodies.
(Little round objects fly into view.)
DOCTOR: Nobody move Any attempt to help him, or attack those things, will identify you as a secondary source of infection. Stay still!
(The antibodies open to reveal a big blue eye, then surround Ross.)
CLARA: But the Dalek wants us in here. Why is it attacking?
DOCTOR: Can you control your antibodies?
JOURNEY: Ross, stay calm. We're going to get you out of this.
CLARA: Can you?
DOCTOR: Ross, swallow that.
ROSS: What is it?
DOCTOR: Trust me.
(Ross swallows the little whatever it was that the Doctor threw to him.)
ROSS: Now what?
(An antibody aims a painful bright beam at him.)
JOURNEY: Ross!
(Ross disintegrates.)
CLARA: Oh, my God. What's it doing?
(The antibody sucks up the remains and its blue eye turns red,)
DOCTOR: The hoovering.
(The antibody flies away. The Doctor raises his sonic screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: Gotcha.
CLARA: What did you give him?
DOCTOR: Oh, just a spare power cell, but I can track the radiation signature. I need to know where they dump the bodies.
JOURNEY: I thought you were saving him.
DOCTOR: He was dead already. I was saving us. Follow me and run.
CLARA: Run!
(The other antibodies follow at a distance. The Doctor stops at a hole in the ledge.)
DOCTOR: They've dumped him in here. Organic refuse disposal. We need to get in there.
CLARA: Why?
(Gretchen and Journey shoot at the antibodies.)
DOCTOR: Those antibodies won't give up until we're inside there. I'd rather go in alive than dead.
JOURNEY: You don't know where it goes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Away from here. Now in. In! In!
(Clara jumps down the hole.)
GRETCHEN: I can hold them off.
DOCTOR: No, you can't.
(He tries his screwdriver on the antibodies.)
DOCTOR: Pull back. Down. Jump, everyone, jump.
(The Doctor goes in last, and enjoys the ride.)

[Organic refuse disposal]

(They splosh into liquid gunk. Shades of Star Wars episode IV.)
CLARA: Urgh. What is this stuff?
DOCTOR: People. The Daleks need protein. Occasionally, they harvest from their victims. This is a feeding tube.
JOURNEY: Is Ross here?
DOCTOR: Yeah. Top layer, if you want to say a few words.
(Journey pushes the Doctor against the wall.)
JOURNEY: A man has just died. You will not talk like that.
DOCTOR: A lot of people have died. Everything in here is dead, and do you know why that's good?
JOURNEY: There is nothing good about that.
DOCTOR: Nothing is alive in here, so logically this is the weakest spot in the Dalek's internal security. Nobody guards the dead. Mortuaries and larders, always the easiest to break out of. Oh, I've lived a life Tell Uncle Stupid that we're in. Ah ha! A bolt hole.
(The Doctor unscrews the large bolt with the sonic screwdriver.)
CLARA:  He'll get us out of here. The difficult part is not killing him before he can.
DOCTOR: Bolt hole. Actually, a hole for a bolt. Does nobody get that?
CLARA: Also, there's the puns.
DOCTOR: Watch it, decontamination tubes are hot.

[Lab 01]

(The schematic on the screen shows our heroes' Nanotags are just over half way down Rusty's innards, below where he is sitting by the plunger and gun arms.)
COMPUTER: Anomaly threat displaced. Dalek levels returning to normal parameters.
JOURNEY [OC]: Rescue One to Mission Control.
MORGAN: This is Blue, Rescue One. Report.

[Decontamination tube]

JOURNEY:The Dalek has an internal defence mechanism.

[Lab 01]

JOURNEY [OC]: We've lost Ross.
MORGAN: What kind of defence mechanism?

[Decontamination tube]

MORGAN [OC]: That thing knows you're in there to help it.
JOURNEY: Yeah, well, who knows? It's a Dalek. We're going to continue the mission.
DOCTOR: Are you all right back there? It's a bit narrow, isn't it?
CLARA: Any remarks about my hips will not be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Ach, your hips are fine. You're built like a man.
CLARA: (sotto) Thanks.

[Power unit]

(The Doctor helps Clara down from the tube.)
DOCTOR: What's that noise? Are you wearing a Geiger counter?
GRETCHEN: Standard battle equipment. That's just low level radiation.
(There are large printed circuit boards here.)
DOCTOR: But stronger down here, for some reason. Gimme.
MORGAN [OC]: Was that him?

[Lab 01]

MORGAN: How's he working out?
JOURNEY [OC]: It's hard to say.

[Power unit]

JOURNEY: He's
(The Doctor sweeps the circuit boards with the Geiger counter.)
DOCTOR: I've got it. I know what's wrong with Rusty.
CLARA: Okay, that's good. Is that good?
DOCTOR: Well, you know how I said this was the most dangerous place in the universe? I was wrong. It's way more dangerous than that.

[Lab 01]

JOURNEY [OC]: Colonel, we have radiation indicators red-lining in here. Could be that the Dalek is badly damaged than we thought.
MORGAN: Copy that.
DOCTOR [OC]: Old Rusty here is suffering a trionic radiation leak.

[Power unit]

DOCTOR: It's poisoning the Dalek and us. Just as well we're here.
JOURNEY: Really? Perhaps we should get out while we can. Why should we trust a Dalek? Why would it change? 

[Organic compartment]

(Rusty is watching them on an internal monitor.)
DOCTOR [on screen]: Good question. Rusty? What changed you?
RUSTY: I saw beauty.
DOCTOR [on screen]: You saw what?
RUSTY: In the silence and the cold, I saw worlds burning.
JOURNEY [on screen]: That's not beauty, that's destruction.
RUSTY: I saw

[Power unit]

RUSTY [OC]: More.
DOCTOR: What? What did you see?
RUSTY [OC]: The birth of a star.
DOCTOR: Stars are born every day. You've seen a million stars born. So what?
RUSTY [OC]: Daleks have destroyed a million stars.

[Organic compartment]

DOCTOR [on screen]: Oh, millions and millions. Trust me, I keep count.
RUSTY: And yet, new stars are born.
DOCTOR [on screen]: Every time.

[Power unit]

RUSTY [OC]: Resistance is futile.
DOCTOR: Resistance to what?
RUSTY [OC]: Life returns. Life prevails. Resistance is futile.
DOCTOR : So you saw a star being born, and you learned something. Oh, Dalek, do not be lying to me. Come on.

[Lab 01]

JOURNEY [OC]: Heading for the Trionic power cells, Colonel.
MORGAN: Radiation approxing two hundred Rads. Danger levels.
COMPUTER: Radiation levels increasing.

[Power cell]

(Directly underneath Rusty.)
DOCTOR: We're at the heart of the Dalek.
CLARA: It's incredible.
(Energy arcs above them.)
JOURNEY: Geiger counter's off the scale. Looks like it's about to blow.
DOCTOR: Good.
JOURNEY: How is that good?
DOCTOR: Well, I like a bit of pressure. Rusty, can you hear me?
RUSTY [OC]: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Rusty, we've found the damage. I'm sealing up the breach in your power cell.
(He uses the sonic screwdriver as a welder.)
DOCTOR: No more radiation poisoning. Good as new. There. Job done.
CLARA: That's it? Just like that?
DOCTOR: An anti-climax once in a while is good for my hearts. Rusty? How do you feel? Rusty? Rusty? Rusty.
RUSTY [OC]: The malfunction is corrected.
JOURNEY: What's happened?
DOCTOR: Not entirely sure.
(Lights come on.)
JOURNEY: It's like it's waking up.
DOCTOR: Rusty, come on, talk to me. What's going on?
RUSTY [OC]: The malfunction is corrected. All systems are functioning.

[Rusty's room]

RUSTY: Weapons charged.

[Power cell]

DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no.

[Rusty's room]

RUSTY: Exterminate. Exterminate.
(Rusty kills the man keeping watch through the window in his cell door. It is a return to the classic black and white skeleton effect as the victim dies. Rusty breaks free and Morgan sounds the alarm.)

[Power cell]

DOCTOR: No, no, no,
RUSTY [OC]: Exterminate.

[Lab 01]

RUSTY: Exterminate.

[Power cell]

(The team are thrown about as Rusty moves.)
RUSTY [OC]: The Daleks will be victorious The rebels will be exterminated.
JOURNEY: Colonel? What's happening out there?

[Lab 01]

(Morgan and his troops are too busy shooting at Rusty.)
RUSTY: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.
(Two more soldiers die.)
RUSTY: Exterminate. (and another) Exterminate.
MORGAN: Pull back, pull back.
(Rusty plugs into a console with his plunger arm.)
RUSTY: Dalek fleet. Communications open.

[Saucer]

DALEK: The rebel ship has been identified.
DALEK 2: Prepare fourteen Daleks.

[Power cell]

CLARA: Doctor, what happened?
DOCTOR: Do you see?
CLARA: Do I see what?
DOCTOR: Daleks don't turn good. It was just radiation affecting its brain chemistry, nothing more than that. No miracle.
JOURNEY: Let me get this straight. We had a good Dalek, and we made it bad again? That's all we've done?
DOCTOR: There was never a good Dalek. There was a broken Dalek and we repaired it.
JOURNEY: You were supposed to be helping us.
DOCTOR: I gave it a shot. It didn't work out. It was a Dalek, what did you expect?
JOURNEY: No more talking. You are done! Okay, new objective. We are taking this Dalek down.
RUSTY [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.
DOCTOR: What's that look for?
CLARA: It's the look you get when I'm about to slap you.
(And she does. Hard.)
DOCTOR: Ow. Clara.
CLARA: Are we going to die in here? I mean, there's a little bit of you that's pleased. The Daleks are evil after all. Everything makes sense. The Doctor is right.
DOCTOR: Daleks are evil. Irreversibly so. That's what we just learned.
CLARA: No, Doctor, that is not what we just learned.

[Aristotle]

RUSTY [OC]: Exterminate. Exterminate.
MORGAN: Secure the door! Wasp fighters to action stations. Wasp fighters to action stations.
SOLDIER [OC]: The security systems have been hacked. We don't have access to the Wasps.
MORGAN: Then God save us all.

[Power cell]

JOURNEY: We need to place these charges for maximum effect. I'm going to scan the rest of the architecture for weaknesses.
CLARA: One question.
JOURNEY: No time.
(Journey and Gretchen place grenades on handy surfaces.)
CLARA: Why did we come here today? What was the point? You. You thought there was a good Dalek. What difference would one good Dalek make?
DOCTOR: All the difference in the universe, but it's impossible.
CLARA: Is that a fact? Is that really what we've learned today? Think about it. Is that what we've learned?

[Aristotle]

MORGAN: Journey, what the hell's happening? That thing's set the Daleks on us.

[Power cell]

MORGAN [OC]: And it's locked us out of our defences.

[Aristotle]

MORGAN: Journey, you're the Aristotle's only hope.

[Power cell]

MORGAN [OC]: I need you to destroy that Dalek.

[Aristotle]

RUSTY: The rebels will be exterminated.
MORGAN: Whatever it takes.

[Power cell]

JOURNEY: Understood, Uncle.

[Aristotle]

MORGAN: I'm sorry.

[Power cell]

JOURNEY: Yeah. Me too.
DOCTOR: Clara Oswald, do I really not pay you?
CLARA: You couldn't afford me.
DOCTOR: Whatever you're going to do, don't do it This Dalek must not be destroyed. We can do better.
JOURNEY: Are you out of your mind?
DOCTOR: No, I'm inside a Dalek. I'm standing where I've never been. We cannot waste this chance. It won't come again.
JOURNEY: What chance? I have my orders.
DOCTOR: Soldiers take orders.
JOURNEY: And I'm a soldier.
DOCTOR: A Dalek is a better soldier than you will ever be. You can't win this way.
(Journey holds up a grenade to pull the pin, then puts it down again.)
JOURNEY: Bah! So what do we do?
DOCTOR: Something better.

[Saucer]

DALEK: Prepare to board the rebel ship. We must find our comrade Dalek. Spare no humans. Exterminate them all.
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.
(The Saucer flies over the asteroid where the Aristotle is hiding.)

[Inner casing]

(They climb up to a recess.)
DOCTOR: The Dalek isn't just some angry blob in a Dalekanium tank. If it was, the radiation would have turned it into a raging lunatic.
JOURNEY: It is a raging lunatic, it's a Dalek.
DOCTOR: But for a moment, it wasn't. The radiation allowed it to expand its consciousness, to consider things beyond its natural terms of reference. It became good. That means a good Dalek is possible. That's what we learned today. Am I right, teach?
CLARA: Top of the class.
JOURNEY: But now it's back to how it was.
DOCTOR: But what it saw, what it felt, is still there.
JOURNEY: Yeah, I'm not really seeing that.
DOCTOR: Not here. There.
(He points upwards.)
JOURNEY: You mean in the cortex vault?
CLARA: The evil engineering?
DOCTOR: Every memory recorded. Some suppressed, but all still intact. We need to show the Dalek that star being born again. Recreate that moment. You need to get up there, find that moment and reawaken it.
CLARA: Me?
DOCTOR: Yes, you. Good idea.
CLARA: How?
DOCTOR: Haven't the foggiest. Do a clever thing. And then once you've done it, the Dalek will be suggestible to new ideas. It will be open again. And I will show it something that will change its mind forever
JOURNEY: What? Not a clue.

[Aristotle docking port]

DALEK [OC]: Docking initiated.
(The space doors are blown in.)
DALEK [OC]: Pressures equalised. Boarding corp, begin attack.
DALEK 2: Advance. Exterminate the humans.
DALEKS: Seek, locate, destroy. Surrender is not accepted.
(Note - as they come through the burning spacedoors, some of the rubber plungers catch fire.)

[Inner casing]

JOURNEY: This is crazy. There is no way that we can get back up there in time.
GRETCHEN: Yes, there is.
JOURNEY: No, Gretchen. It'll bring the antibodies back down on us.
GRETCHEN: Tell me the truth. Is he mad, or is he right? I've come this far. Probably going to die anyway. Wouldn't mind something to do for the rest of my life. Is he mad, or is he right? CLARA: Hand on my heart? Most days he's both.
GRETCHEN: One question, then. Is this worth it?
DOCTOR: If I can turn one Dalek, I can turn them all. I can save the future.
GRETCHEN: Gretchen Alison Carlisle. Do something good and name it after me.
DOCTOR: I will do something amazing, I promise.
GRETCHEN: Damn well better.
(Gretchen primes her harpoon.)
JOURNEY: No, Gretchen.
(She fires two wires up to the cranial ledge.)
GRETCHEN: Go.
(Antibodies approach.)
CLARA: They're coming. They're coming.
(Journey fastens a pulley onto the zip wire.)
JOURNEY: Grab hold of the rope. Don't look down.
GRETCHEN: Good luck.
(Journey and Clara fly upwards. The Doctor leaves, and Gretchen shoots at the antibodies until she is killed, screaming.)

[Tea rooms]

(And stops screaming when she realises she is still breathing and sitting down. Gretchen looks at the Edwardian lady seated across the tea table by the French windows.)
MISSY: Hello. I'm Missy. Welcome to heaven. Would you like some tea? Little splosh? Lovely.

{Aristotle]

MORGAN: Fire!
DALEK: Exterminate. Advance. Seek, locate, destroy.
DALEK 2: Seek, locate, destroy.
DALEK 3: Exterminate.
(A Dalek goes KaBOOM!)
DALEK: Advance. Seek, locate.
DALEK 2: Exterminate. Exterminate.

[Organic compartment]

DOCTOR: Well, Rusty, here we are. Eye to eye.
RUSTY: You cannot save the humans. They will be exterminated.

[Lab 01]

RUSTY: I shall join the Dalek units in the final attack.

[Cranial ledge]

JOURNEY: So what do we do?
CLARA: Er, a clever thing, quickly. Think, think, think, think, think. Some of the lights are out.
JOURNEY: Yeah, we've got a damaged Dalek. You want to complain to someone?
CLARA: But it's not damaged, look at them.
JOURNEY: So?
CLARA: So, the Doctor said this was a memory bank and some of the memories were suppressed. What if. What if the dark spots are hidden memories? What if one of those is the Dalek seeing a star?
JOURNEY: Seriously?
CLARA: Yeah. Well, maybe. It's either that or the bulbs need changing.
JOURNEY: It really could be the bulbs.
CLARA: Got a better idea?
JOURNEY: Really wish I had.
CLARA: Yep, me too. Ah-ha.
(She pulls one of the panels off.)
CLARA: Watch out for antibodies. Let's see if there's an on switch.
(Clara goes behind, into the memory banks.)

[Organic compartment]

DOCTOR: I saved your life, Rusty. Now I'm going to go one better. I'm going to save your soul.
RUSTY: Daleks do not have souls.
DOCTOR: Oh, no? Imagine if you did. What then, Rusty? What would happen then?

[Cortex vault]

CLARA: I'm in the cortex.

[Cranial ledge]

JOURNEY: If there's a pack of spare bulbs, break it to me gently.
(Clara hits a dark panel and there is a flash. Some lights come on. The Doctor sees the flash travel down neurones to Rusty. Images of dying soldiers are on the screens.)

[Organic compartment]

DOCTOR: Your memories. I'm about to give some back to you.

[Cranial ledge]

JOURNEY: Are you okay? Clara?

[Cortex vault]

CLARA: Yeah. I think there was some sort of energy charge.

[Cranial ledge]

JOURNEY: You got the first lights on.

[Cortex vault]

CLARA: Of course, it's a brain. Brains work with electrical pathways linking up memories. It's working. It's working, we're turning the memories back on.
(She continues to crawl over flexible tubing.)

[Organic compartment]

DOCTOR: See, all those years ago, when I began
(The Doctor is using his sonic screwdriver to cut through the flexible tubing covering a set of neurones, then pulls them apart.)
DOCTOR: I was just running. I called myself the Doctor, but it was just a name. And then I went to Skaro. And then I met you lot and I understood who I was. The Doctor was not the Daleks.

[Aristotle]

DALEKS: Exterminate.
MORGAN: Fall back. Follow me. Fall back.
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.

[Cranial ledge]

(Antibodies are rising up through Rusty's body.)
JOURNEY: You'd better get a move on, There's company coming.

[Aristotle]

(Soldiers continue to die as Daleks close in from all corridors.)
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate.
MORGAN: Fall back, fall back.
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate.
(The soldiers seal a bulkhead door.)

[Cranial ledge]

(Journey starts shooting at antibodies.)
JOURNEY: Hurry up!

[Cortex vault]

CLARA: Show me a star, Rusty.
(More lights come back on.)

[Organic compartment]

(Impulses flow down the cables to Rusty. These images are of Daleks flying in space, attacking the Valiant in Stolen Earth.)
DOCTOR: Oh, look. It's your memories again. It's like somebody's mucking about up there. Memories, all those memories. Do you remember the star you saw being born?

[Cortex vault]

CLARA: Almost done. One more to go.

[Cranial ledge]

JOURNEY: Hurry up, Clara! Hurry up.
(The last set of lights come on, and Rusty's eyepiece goes dark. The antibodies retreat.)
JOURNEY: Clara, you did it. It's rebooting.

[Cortex vault]

JOURNEY [OC]: The antibodies have reset.

[Organic compartment]

RUSTY: I, I remember.
DOCTOR: You saw the truth, Rusty. Remember how you felt. You saw a star being born. The endless rebirth of the universe.
RUSTY: No.
DOCTOR: And you realised the truth about the Daleks

[Aristotle]

(Rusty is spinning around.)
RUSTY: Truth? What is the truth?

[Organic compartment]

DOCTOR: Let me show you the truth. I've opened your mind and now I'm coming in.

[Aristotle]

(The Daleks are starting to burn through the bulkhead door.)
MORGAN: That door is never going to hold. But I'm damned if I'm going to make it easy for them.

[Rusty's mind]

(The Doctor splices the two pieces of cut neurone together with his bare hands, and screams as the energy surges through his body.)
DOCTOR: I'm part of you. My mind is in your mind. 

[Lab 01]

RUSTY: I see your mind, Doctor. I see your universe.

[Rusty's mind]

DOCTOR: And isn't the universe beautiful?
RUSTY [OC]: I see beauty.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. That is good. Hold on to that.
RUSTY [OC]: I see endless, divine perfection.
DOCTOR: Make it a part of you. Remember how you feel right now. Put it inside you and live by it.
RUSTY [OC]: I see into your soul, Doctor. I see beauty. I see divinity. I see hatred.
DOCTOR: Hatred? 

[Lab 01]

RUSTY: I see your hatred of the Daleks and it is good.

[Rusty's mind]

(Behind the Doctor, the Crucible explodes.)
DOCTOR: No, no, no. You must see more than that, there must be more than that.

[Lab 01]

RUSTY: Death to the Daleks.

[Rusty's mind]

RUSTY [OC]: Death to the Daleks. Death to the Daleks.
DOCTOR: No, there must be more than that. There must be more than that. Please.

[Aristotle]

RUSTY: Daleks are evil. Daleks must be exterminated. Daleks are evil.
(Rusty approaches his former comrades from the rear, while Morgan and his surviving soldiers prepare for them to break through the bulkhead door.)
MORGAN: God save us all.
RUSTY: Daleks must be exterminated.
(The Daleks turn and Rusty shoots them to pieces.)
RUSTY: Exterminate.
DALEK: Under attack from a Dalek!
(KaBOOMs all round!)
RUSTY: The Daleks are exterminated

[Rusty's mind]

DOCTOR: Of course they are. That's what you do, isn't it?

[Aristotle]

(The humans have left Rusty and are normal size again.)
MORGAN: Journey.
JOURNEY: Uncle Morgan.
RUSTY: I have transmitted a retreat signal. The Daleks will believe the humans have initiated the ship's self-destruct.
(Journey briefly hugs Morgan.)
CLARA: What about you, Rusty?
RUSTY: I must go with them.
DOCTOR: Of course you must. You've unfinished work, haven't you?
RUSTY: Victory is yours, but it does not please you.
DOCTOR: You looked inside me and you saw hatred. That's not victory. Victory would have been a good Dalek.
RUSTY: I am not a good Dalek. You are a good Dalek.
(Rusty turns to leave, then looks back at the Doctor.)
DOCTOR: Till the next time.
(The Doctor goes through the door to Med Sec 07.)
JOURNEY: Is he leaving? Isn't he going to say goodbye?
CLARA: I think that was it. Yep, that was it. Sorry, got to run.
(Clara goes after the Doctor. Rusty leaves.)
JOURNEY: I'm sorry.
(Journey kisses Morgan on the cheek and follows Clara.)
MORGAN: Sorry?

[Med Sec 07]

JOURNEY: Doctor. Take me with you.
DOCTOR: I think you're probably nice. Underneath it all, I think you're kind and you're definitely brave. I just wish you hadn't been a soldier.
(Journey and Clara exchange final sheepish smiles before Clara follows the Doctor into the Tardis. The Dalek Saucer leaves the asteroid belt.)

[Tardis]

(Clara runs up the stairs in new clothes. The Tardis is in flight.)
CLARA: How do I look?
DOCTOR: Sort of short and round-ish, but with a good personality, which is the main thing.
CLARA: I meant my clothes. I just changed.
DOCTOR: Oh, good for you, still making an effort.
(The Tardis lands.)
DOCTOR: Okay, right, you're back in your cupboard, thirty seconds after you left.
CLARA: When will I see you again?
DOCTOR: Oh. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those.
(Clara opens the door.)
CLARA: I don't know.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?
CLARA: You asked me if you're a good man and the answer is, I don't know. But I think you try to be and I think that's probably the point.
DOCTOR: I think you're probably an amazing teacher.
CLARA: I think I'd better be.

[Corridor]

(Clara comes out of the supply cupboard.)
DANNY: Ah, hey.
CLARA: Hey, Danny.
DANNY: Have you changed your clothes?
CLARA: Yes. Yes, I, I have. Well noticed.
DANNY: Okay, good.
CLARA: Yes, good. Very good. Good work. You passed the test.
DANNY: Are you really going to go for a drink with me?
CLARA: Yeah, course I am. Why wouldn't I?
DANNY: I just thought
CLARA: Thought what?
DANNY: I thought you might have a rule against soldiers.
CLARA: No. No, not at all.
(They go different ways.)
CLARA: Not me.

[Tardis]

(The Doctor is doing Gallifreyan maths on a blackboard up on the gallery, near his bookcase. Clara is down by the console, swivelling in his easy chair.)
DOCTOR: Take a punt.
CLARA: Right.
DOCTOR: Your choice. Wherever, whenever, anywhere in time and space.
CLARA: Well, there is something, someone that I've always wanted to meet. But I know what you'll say.
DOCTOR: Try me.
CLARA: You'll say he's made up, that there is no such thing.
DOCTOR: Go on.
CLARA: It's. It's Robin Hood.
DOCTOR: Robin Hood.
(Clara goes up to the gallery.)
CLARA: Yeah. I love that story. I've always loved it, ever since I was little.
DOCTOR: Robin Hood, the heroic outlaw, who robs from the rich and gives to the poor.
CLARA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: He's made up. There's no such thing.
CLARA: Ah, you see?
(The Doctor takes a book from the bookcase.)
DOCTOR: Old-fashioned heroes only exist in old-fashioned story books, Clara.
CLARA: And what about you?
DOCTOR: Me?
CLARA: Yeah, you. You stop bad things happening every minute of every day. That sounds pretty heroic to me.
(The Doctor licks something from a large metal spoon. Custard?)
DOCTOR: Just passing the time. Hey, what about Mars?
CLARA: What?!
DOCTOR: The Ice Warrior Hives.
CLARA: You said it was my choice.
DOCTOR: Or the Tumescent Arrows of the Half-Light. Those girls can hold their drink.
CLARA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: And fracture fifteen different levels of reality simultaneously. I think I've got a Polaroid somewhere.
CLARA: Doctor! My choice. Robin Hood. Show me.
(They go down to the console.)
DOCTOR: Very well.
(He sets the coordinates.)
DOCTOR: Earth. England. Sherwood Forest. 1190AD. Ish. But you'll only be disappointed.
(He sets the Tardis flying. Meanwhile, the first Doctor is meeting Richard the Lionheart at the Crusades.)

[By a stream]

(The birds are singing, and a long tree trunk has been placed across the stream to act as a bridge. The Tardis materialises slightly up the slope and the Doctor steps out.)
DOCTOR: No damsels in distress, no pretty castles, no such thing as Robin Hood.
(An arrow slams into the Tardis next to him. A figure in dressed in Lincoln Green pops up from behind a tree trunk on the other side of the stream.)
ROBIN: You called? (and winks.) Very, very nicely done with the box, sir. I saw a Turk perform something very similar at Nottingham Fayre.
(The Doctor pulls the arrow out, and the hole vanishes.)
ROBIN: It's a trick with mirrors, no doubt?
DOCTOR: A trick?
ROBIN: A good jest. Ha, ha!
DOCTOR: This is not a trick. This is a Tardis.
ROBIN: Whatever it is, you bony rascal, I'm afraid I must relieve you of it.
DOCTOR: It's my property, that's what it is.
ROBIN: Well, don't you know all property is theft to Robin Hood?
(Robin stands in the middle of the 'bridge' without his bow and arrows.)
DOCTOR: You're not serious.
ROBIN: I'm many things, sir, but I'm never that. Robin Hood laughs in the face of all. Ha, ha, ha.
DOCTOR: And do people ever punch you in the face when you do that?
ROBIN: Not as yet.
DOCTOR: Lucky I'm here then, isn't it?
(Clara comes out of the Tardis, dressed in a red medieval-style dress, with long cut-away sleeves and a thin girdle around her hips. There is also a silver rope across her forehead that stays in place as if glued there.)
CLARA: Might be a little bit much, but what do you reckon, Doctor?
ROBIN: By all the saints. Are there any more in there?
CLARA: Is that?
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! It is, isn't it? You found him. You actually found Robin Hood.
(Clara goes very girlish and giggly.)
DOCTOR: That is not Robin Hood.
ROBIN: Well then, who, sir, is about to relieve you of your magic box?
(Robin draws his long sword. The Doctor walks onto the bridge.)
DOCTOR: Nobody, sir. Not in this universe or the next.
ROBIN: Well then, draw your sword and prove your words.
DOCTOR: I have no sword. I don't need a sword.
(The Doctor opens his coat and turns to prove it.)
DOCTOR: Because I am the Doctor.
(He dons a gauntlet.)
DOCTOR: And this is my spoon. En garde!
(They trade thrusts and parries. The spoon stands up to the sword very well. The Doctor hits Robin on the back of the neck as he passes him.)
ROBIN: Ow!
CLARA: You're amazing.
DOCTOR: I've had some experience. Richard the Lionheart. Cyrano de Bergerac. Errol Flynn. He had the most enormous
CLARA: Ahem.
DOCTOR: Ego.
CLARA: Takes one to know one.
(The Doctor slaps Robin's backside.)
ROBIN: Oh, you.
(And retaliates by cutting a button off the Doctor's coat. So the Doctor holds his arms wide open and Robin lunges with his sword. The Doctor deflects it and does a little turn so that he and Robin are back to back on the trunk. Then he sticks out his bottom and pushes Robin into the water. Splash!)
CLARA: Doctor!
(The Doctor polishes his spoon.)
DOCTOR: Like I said. My box.
CLARA: Doctor?
(They look into the water. Robin is not visible. Because he pops up behind the Doctor and pushes him into the water. Clara and Robin laugh.)

[Settlement]

(A few thatched wattle-and-daub buildings, and a Celtic cross on a plinth. Knights in full armour are making the chickens scatter. A young woman is being dragged away chained to yoke across her shoulders. An old man runs up.)
QUAYLE: In the name of all that's holy, take our money, take our treasure, but spare my ward.
QUAYLES WARD: Do not fuss. All will be well.
QUAYLE: This is the Sheriff's doing. If he were here now, I'd tear out his black heart!
(A figure back-lit sitting on a horse speaks.)
SHERIFF: Would you now?
(He dismounts.)
SHERIFF: Or are you as milk-livered as your name suggests, Master Quayle?
QUAYLE: Take me. Spare this dear child.
SHERIFF: Take you? A lardy lack-wit like you? It's labour we require up at the castle. Labour and gold. Not old men and their worthless baubles. This will be a great help, Master Quayle, believe me. Newcomer to Sherwood, are we?
QUAYLES WARD: Yes, my Lord.
SHERIFF: You may also prove useful. Bring her.
QUAYLE: Your days are numbered, you cur.
(Quayle spits in the Sheriff's face.)
SHERIFF: You shall live to regret that. Actually, no. You won't.
(The Sheriff stabs Quayle in the stomach.)
QUAYLES WARD:  No! No!

[Outlaw's hideaway]

(In a narrow gullly.The outlaws live in shallow caves under the treeline. Robin is making me think of a subdued Lord Flashheart from Blackadder 2, with Clara as Bob.)
ROBIN: Let me introduce you to my men. This is Will Scarlet. He is a cheeky rogue with a good sword arm and a slippery tongue.
WILL: My lady.
(The Doctor pulls some of his hair out as he bows, and scans it with the sonic screwdriver.)
WILL: Argh! What do you want with my hair?
DOCTOR: Well, it's realistic, I'll give you that.
ROBIN: And this is Friar Tuck. Aptly named for the amount of grub he tucks into.
TUCK: You skinny blackguard.
(These men laugh a lot. As he steps forward, he nearly falls.)
TUCK: What are you doing?
(The Doctor stands up with one of his sandals)
DOCTOR: This isn't a real sandal.
TUCK: Yes, it is.
DOCTOR: (sniffs) Oh. Yes, it is.
ROBIN: This, er, is Alan-a-Dale. He's a master of the lute, whose music brightens up these dark days.
ALAN: (sings) Stranger you are welcome here, in Sherwood's bonny glade. Ow!
(The Doctor has jabbed his arm with a hypodermic gizmo.)
DOCTOR: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Blood analysis. Oh. All those diseases. If you were real, you'd be dead in six months.
ALAN: I am real.
DOCTOR: Bye.
ROBIN: And this is John Little. Called Little John. He's my loyal companion in many an adventure.
(The man mountain steps aside and a small man jumps forward, to general merriment.)
CLARA: Oh!
WILL: Works every time.
CLARA: Oh, I cannot believe this. You, you really are Robin Hood and his Merry Men.
ROBIN: Aye! That is an apt description. What say you, lads?
ALL: Aye!
DOCTOR: Stop laughing. Why are you always doing that? Are you all simple or something? I'm going to need a sample.
(The Doctor picks up a goblet and throws away the contents before walking up to Robin..)
ROBIN: Of what?
CLARA: Ahem. Excuse me. Sorry. What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Well, they're not holograms, that much is obvious. Could be a theme park from the future. Or we might be inside a miniscope.
(As in Carnival of Monsters)
CLARA: Oh, shut up.
DOCTOR: A miniscope. Yes, of course. Why not?
ROBIN: Your friend seems not quite of the real world.
CLARA: No. No, he's not really. Not most of the time. Dark days?
ROBIN: My lady?
CLARA: You said that these were dark days. What did you mean?
WILL: King Richard is away on crusade, my lady. His tyrant of a brother rules instead.
CLARA: And the Sheriff. Cos there is a sheriff, right?
ALAN: Aye. It is indeed this jackal of the princes who seeks to oppress us for ever more.
DOCTOR: Or six months in your case.
ROBIN: It is a shame to dwell on murky thoughts when there is such beauty here.
CLARA: Why are you so sad?
ROBIN: Why do you think me sad?
CLARA: Because the Doctor's right, you laugh too much.
ROBIN: You know, I do not live this outlaw life by choice. You see before you Robert.
BOTH: Earl of Loxley.
CLARA: Yes.
ROBIN: Yes.
CLARA: Sorry. Do go on.
ROBIN: I er, I had my lands and titles stripped from me. I dared to speak out against Prince John. But I lost the thing most dear to me.
CLARA: What was she called?
ROBIN: You're so very quick. How does the Doctor stand it?
CLARA: Marian?
ROBIN: You know her?
CLARA: Oh, yes. I have always known her.
ROBIN: It was Marian who told me that I must stand up and be counted. But, I was afraid. Now this green canopy is my palace and the rough ground my feather bed. Maybe one day I will return home, but until that day. Until that day, it is beholden on me to be the man Marian wanted, to be a hero for those this tyrant sheriff slaughters.
DOCTOR: What time is it, Mister Hood?
ROBIN: Somewhat after noon.
DOCTOR: No, no. Time of year? What season?
ROBIN: Oh, Dame Autumn has draped her mellow skirts about the forest, Doctor. The time of mists and harvest approaches.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. All very poetic. But it's very green hereabouts, though, isn't it? Like I said, very sunny.
CLARA: So?
DOCTOR: Have you been to Nottingham?
CLARA: Climate change?
DOCTOR: It's 1190.
ROBIN: You must excuse me. The Sheriff has issued a proclamation and tomorrow there is to be a contest to find the best archer in the land. And the bounty, it's an arrow made of pure gold.
CLARA: No! Don't, don't go. It's a trap.
ROBIN: Well, of course it is! But a contest to find the best archer in the land? There is no contest.
(General hilarity.)
DOCTOR: Right, that isn't even funny. That was bantering. I am totally against bantering.
CLARA: How can you be so sure he is not the real thing?
DOCTOR: Because he can't be.
CLARA: When did you stop believing in everything?
DOCTOR: When did you start believing in impossible heroes?
CLARA: Don't you know? In a way, it's rather sweet.
(The Doctor bites into an apple then scans it with his screwdriver.)

[Archery ground]

(We are shown Caerphilly Castle with its artificial lakes, which was built from 1268 onwards. Nottingham Castle is built on castle rock by the river with the city around it. The contest is taking place in the central ward.)
HERALD: In the contest for the golden arrow, after ten rounds, the battle is betwixt our Lord Sheriff
(Obligatory cheers from the crowd.)
HERALD: And the stranger known as Tom the Tinker.
(Robin in a wide-brimmed leather hat gets a rousing reception.)
SHERIFF: Perhaps not such a stranger after all.
HERALD: Take your places.
ROBIN: Shall we make the contest a little more interesting, my Lord? The targets seem a little close. What say you? Another twenty paces?
SHERIFF: Why not?
(The central target is moved back. The Sheriff fires his black arrow into the middle of the bulls-eye.)
SHERIFF: Now, Tinker. Let us see thy true face.
(Robin's white-fletched arrow splits the Sheriff's.)
HERALD: Ye Gads! He has split the arrow! Truly, he is the finest archer in all England. Come forward, Tinker. And claim your prize.
(But before Robin can take the prize, an arrow with multicoloured feathers splits his own. It is the Doctor's.)
LITTLE JOHN: He's full of surprises, isn't he?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. My skills as a bowman speak for themselves. I claim my reward.
(The Herald kneels and the Doctor takes the prize.)
DOCTOR: A mere bauble.
(He throws it away in the general direction of the Merry Men.)
DOCTOR: I want something else.
SHERIFF: Name it.
DOCTOR: Enlightenment.
(Robin splits the Doctor's arrow. The crowd roars. The Doctor's next arrow ricochets off a guard's armour to split Robin's. Robin retaliates by not even looking when he looses his missile.)
DOCTOR: This is getting silly.
(The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver at the target, and it explodes in a ball of flame.)
SHERIFF: Fascinating. Seize him!
(The three knights draw their swords. Clara takes what looks like an anachronistic halberd from a rack and tries to swing it. It is too heavy for her.)
DOCTOR: What are you doing? Put that down.
CLARA: I'm fine. I take Year Seven for after school Tae Kwon Do.
ROBIN: Don't worry, Doctor. I'll save you.
DOCTOR: I don't need saving.
ROBIN: Your honour is safe.
DOCTOR: I know.
ROBIN: For I am Robin.
(He removes his hat and every one cheers.)
ROBIN: Robin Hood!
(Robin severs one of the knights' arms. It falls to the ground and sparks a bit.)
VOICE [OC]: Witchery! Witchery!
(The Doctor picks the arm up.)
DOCTOR: Robot.
(The knight's visor opens to reveal a metal face. A violet light shines in a cross pattern from between its eyebrows.)
DOCTOR: Now we're getting somewhere.
SHERIFF: Take them. Kill the rest. Kill them all!
(The robot knights fire energy bolts from their foreheads.)
DOCTOR: He surrenders!
ROBIN: What?
DOCTOR: Hai!
(The Doctor uses Venusian aikido to knock Robin's sword out of his hand.)
ROBIN: You miserable cur. I had them on the run. Flee, lads, flee! Live to fight another day!
TUCK: Come on!
(The Merry Men run for their lives.)
SHERIFF: To the dungeons with all of them.
CLARA: What are you up to?
DOCTOR: Quickest way to find out anybody's plans, get yourself captured.

[Castle]

(Somewhere with little lighting and a high roof. There are screams somewhere and a giant bubbling crucible. A man carrying a bucket collapses on the floor.)
QUAYLES WARD: Here, let me help you.
WALTER: Thank you, Lady.
(A knight looks at them, visor open.)
QUAYLES WARD: What are you? Gargoyle, what are you?
KNIGHT: Leave it.
QUAYLES WARD: He only needs to rest. We all need to rest.
KNIGHT: Analysis shows that peasant creature is spent.
QUAYLES WARD: No. No, please.
KNIGHT: Usefulness expired.
WALTER: No. No! No!
(A violet energy beam turns him into a smoking pile of rags.)
QUAYLES WARD: Damn you! Damn you and that villain the Sheriff!

[Dungeon]

(A skeleton is sitting up against a stake fastened into the floor of the stone chamber. A single cross slit illuminates the room. Our three heros chained together, with the chains running through large hoops set into stones in the floor. Robin is on the left as we look at them, then the Doctor, then Clara..)
ROBIN: Splendid. Enchained.
CLARA: Yep.
ROBIN: Trussed up like turkey-cocks. Thanks to your friend.
DOCTOR: Shut it, Hoodie. I saved your life.
ROBIN: I had the situation well in hand.
DOCTOR: Long-haired ninny versus robot killer knights? I know where I'd put my money.
ROBIN: If you had not betrayed me, I would have been triumphant.
DOCTOR: You would have been a little puff of smoke and ashes.
ROBIN: Oh, ha!
DOCTOR: You'd have been floating around in tiny little laughing bits in people's goblets.
ROBIN: Balderdash. Ha!
DOCTOR: Oh, right, here we go. It's laughing time.
ROBIN: Well, you amuse me, grey old man.
DOCTOR: Guard! He's laughing again! You can't keep me locked up with a laughing person.
ROBIN: Oh, I find that, I find that quite funny. Do you know, I feel another laugh coming on. A-ha-ha-ha!
DOCTOR: Guards, I cannot remain in this cell. Execute me now.
ROBIN: You heard him. Execute the old fool.
DOCTOR: No, hang on. Execute him.
ROBIN: I do not fear death, so execute away.
DOCTOR: Execute him. I'd like to see if his head keeps laughing when you chop it off!
ROBIN: Oh, Robin Hood always laughs in the face of death.
DOCTOR: Yes, rolling around the floor laughing, I would pay good money to see that.
DOCTOR + ROBIN: Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard!
CLARA: Oh, you two, shut up! Do either of you understand, in any way at all, that there isn't actually a guard out there?
DOCTOR: Oh.
ROBIN: I did, in fact.
DOCTOR: No, you didn't.
CLARA: I said, shut up. The Doctor and Robin Hood locked up in a cellar. Is this seriously the best that you can do? You're determined to starve to death in here squabbling.
ROBIN: Well, I'll tell you one thing. I'd last a lot longer than this desiccated man-crone.
DOCTOR: Really?
ROBIN: Really.
DOCTOR: Well, you know what? I think you'll find I have a certain genetic advantage. Oh!
(Clara has yanked on the chain attached to his wrist.)
CLARA: It is not a competition about who can die slower.
DOCTOR: It would definitely be me, though, wouldn't it?
CLARA: There was supposed to be a plan. Do either of you two have a plan?
DOCTOR: Yeah, of course I have a plan.
ROBIN: I too have a plan.
CLARA: Okay. Robin, you first.
DOCTOR: Why him?
CLARA: Doctor, shut up. Robin, your plan.
ROBIN: I am biding my time.
CLARA: Thank you, Prince of Thieves. Last of the Time Lords?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have a plan.
CLARA: Can you explain your plan without using the word sonic screwdriver? Because you might have forgotten the Sheriff of Nottingham has taken your sonic screwdriver, just saying. It's always the screwdriver.
DOCTOR: Okay, let, let, let, let's hear Robin's plan first.
CLARA: Oh, for God's sake.
(The door is unlocked.)
ROBIN: See? There was a guard. There was guard listening the whole time, I knew it. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(The guard is a man with no teeth left, just rotted stumps.)
GUARD: The Sheriff himself commanded me to listen, to find out which of you is the true ringleader.
DOCTOR: Ah, so he can do the interrogating. Very wise.
ROBIN: Excellent. He will get nothing from me.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. no. He will get nothing from me, because interrogation, that's where I always turn the tables. You see, that's my plan.
ROBIN: Just hurry up and take me to him.
DOCTOR: No, no, chop-chop, come on.
(The guard unfastens Clara's chains.)
CLARA: Seriously.
GUARD: Come on. 
DOCTOR: No.
ROBIN: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Don't be ridiculous!
(The door slams shut and is locked.)

[Outlaw's hideaway]

(Night. Little John is holding the golden arrow. It goes from speaker to speaker.)
LITTLE JOHN: 'Tis a thing of beauty indeed.
WILL: And will feed a family for a twelvemonth when melted down.
TUCK: Tonight we rest. Tomorrow we must draw up plans to rescue Robin. We shall soon see how those Mechanicals feel about the taste of Nottingham steel. Lord, forgive me.
ALAN: Strange, though, is it not?
LITTLE JOHN: What?
ALAN: All this looting that the Sheriff is doing, and yet 'tis only ever gold that he takes. Pearls, rubies, all the precious jewels of the realm seem no consequence to him. Only gold.
(He hands the arrow to Tuck and picks up his lute.)
ALAN: (sings) Poor Robin and the stranger lay, In the dungeon all the live-long day. The Merry Men might pine away, Upon a Sherwood morning.
(Back at the castle, we watch artefacts dropping into a giant crucible. One of the knights opens the gate at the bottom and the molten metal pours out into an intricate mould, like a giant printed circuit.)

[Sheriff's room]

SHERIFF: Eat, my Lady, eat. Let it not be said that the Sheriff of Nottingham is a poor host.
(Clara is at the other end of the well-stocked table)
CLARA: I had a bag of crisps this morning, thanks.
SHERIFF: Your words are strange, fair one.
CLARA: Mmm, I should think they are.
SHERIFF: But I like you. You're refreshingly direct.
CLARA: You can take the girl out of Blackpool.
(The Sheriff holds up something oblong wrapped in cling film. Sandwiches? Then the spoon.)
SHERIFF: Taken from your friend's strange tunic. An intriguing gallimaufry. Including this wand. Evidently a thing of awesome power. Tell me, are you from beyond the stars?
CLARA: You're the one with the robot army, you tell me.

[Dungeon]

DOCTOR: I'm sorry?
ROBIN: No. Beat your breast. Moan. Groan as though twenty devils possessed your guts.
DOCTOR: What for?
ROBIN: So as to attract the attention of that gargoyle-faced guard.
DOCTOR: It's your plan. You moan.
ROBIN: No, no. No, it won't work.
DOCTOR: Why?
ROBIN: Oh, because you're clearly more advanced in years and you have a sickly aspect to you.
DOCTOR: I have a what?
ROBIN: You're as pale as milk. It's the way with Scots. They're strangers to vegetables.
DOCTOR: I'm not moaning. You moan.
ROBIN: Fine. If you want something doing. (moans loudly.) Can I rely upon you to do the rest?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know the drill.
(The guard speaks through the grill in the door.)
GUARD: What is this din?
DOCTOR: No business of yours, cur.  (to Robin) Speak up. I can't hear you.
GUARD: What ails him?
DOCTOR: None of your business.
(The guard enters.)
GUARD: I said, what ails him?
DOCTOR: Well, if you must know, he's having a nervous breakdown.
GUARD: A what?
DOCTOR: He's like this whenever he's in any kind of danger. He just can't seem to cope. He gets so afraid. He goes into a kind of fit. I honestly believe that he may die of sheer fright, like some tiny, shivering little mouse. Oh, God, I think he's soiled himself.
GUARD: Let him die. It will save us the trouble of executing him.
DOCTOR: And what will happen to the reward?
GUARD: Reward?
DOCTOR: Oh, God, I shouldn't have said that.
GUARD: Tell me!
DOCTOR: He carries a vital message. The Prince has promised a bounty.
GUARD: A big one? 
DOCTOR: An enormous one.
(Robin mumbles. The guard leans close to him.)
GUARD:  What's that? Say again?
ROBIN: Come closer. Your breath stinks like a serpent, has anyone ever told you that?
(Robin gives the guard a Glasgow kiss. That is, he head-butts him, knocking him out cold.)
ROBIN: Soiled myself?
DOCTOR: Did you? That's getting into character. Okay, keys.
ROBIN: I'll get them.
DOCTOR: No, no. I'll get them.
ROBIN: I'll get them. I'll get them.
DOCTOR: I'm fine, no, no worries. I've got them!
ROBIN: I've got them! I'll get
(The two pairs of competing feet end up kicking the guard's keys down the drain. Splosh.)
DOCTOR: Well, there is a bright side.
ROBIN: Which is?
DOCTOR: Clara didn't see that. 

[Sheriff's room]

SHERIFF: But enough of tawdry matters. Let us talk of softer, sweeter things.
(He uses his dagger to spear a sweetmeat.)
CLARA: Ah. Good, yes, I was hoping we'd get round to that.
SHERIFF: You were?
CLARA: Mmm. For I have known I was destined to draw the eye of a great and powerful man for a long time. Ever since I saw those mysterious lights in the sky.
SHERIFF: You saw them too?
CLARA: And those strange mechanical men, with their promises.
SHERIFF: I too have experienced this.
CLARA: Really? Well, I would never have guessed. Tell me your story.
SHERIFF: Tell me yours.
CLARA: Oh, no, no, no, no. But you have to go first.
SHERIFF: Why so?
CLARA: Because great men always precede.
SHERIFF: You have a point.
CLARA: Your story, then.
SHERIFF: Once upon a time, there was a brave and clever and handsome man.
CLARA:  I can almost picture him. I don't even have to close my eyes.
SHERIFF: Unappreciated by his royal master.
CLARA: Prince John?
SHERIFF: The very same.
CLARA: Then came the lights in the sky, and everything changed.
SHERIFF: The skyship came to Earth in a fury of fire.
CLARA: I'd almost call it a crash. I remember it well.
SHERIFF: A craft from the heavenly spheres, bedight with twinkling lights and miracles beyond imagining. The most beautiful thing the brave and handsome man had ever seen.
CLARA: And I suppose the mechanical men saw you as their natural leader?
SHERIFF: It was I and I alone to whom the mechanical men then imparted their secrets. Shortly, I shall be the most powerful man in the realm. King in all but name, for Nottingham is not enough.
CLARA: It isn't?
SHERIFF: After this, Derby.
CLARA: Right.
SHERIFF: Then Lincoln. And after Lincoln
CLARA: Worksop?
(The Sheriff stabs his dagger into the table.)
SHERIFF: The world! 

[Passageway]

(Robin is carrying the block with the loop their chains are running through.)
ROBIN: Now what?
DOCTOR: First, a blacksmith's forge.
ROBIN: So as to remove our chains?
DOCTOR: No. So I can knock up an ornamental plant stand. Of course it's so we can get rid of our chains. I don't want to be manacled to you all night.
(Robin laughs.)
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Please, don't do that.
ROBIN: Ornamental plant stand.
DOCTOR: It's not even that funny.
ROBIN: You're an amusing fellow, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't. Can you just stop! You'll give yourself a hernia.

[Sheriff's room]

CLARA: So what are you hanging around here for, then, Your Majesty? Why are you bothering to squeeze pips out of peasants if you've got a skyship on stand-by?
SHERIFF: Enough questions. I'm impatient to hear your story.
CLARA: Oh, but I do not have one. I was lying.
SHERIFF: Lying?
CLARA: Yeah. People are so much better at sharing information if they think the other person has already got it.
SHERIFF: Oh, that's very clever.
CLARA: Thank you.
SHERIFF: You'll do very well.
CLARA: For what?
SHERIFF: Doesn't every king require a consort?
(The sheriff leans over Clara for a kiss, and she manages to duck out.)
CLARA: Right, you do that again and you'll regret that.

[Spaceship]

(The Doctor and Robin come up some steps free of their chains. The Doctor spots an interesting sight - a metal doorway. He goes through it. The area is long, spartan and metal with a glowing hemisphere on a console at the end.)
DOCTOR: At last. Something real. No more fairy tales.
ROBIN: What is this place?
DOCTOR: A spaceship. More twenty ninth century than twelfth. Data banks, data banks, data banks. Where was this ship headed?
(The computer screen gives all the details.)
DOCTOR: The Promised Land again. Like the Half-Faced Man, but more sophisticated. It disguised itself as a twelfth century castle.
(Graphic shows the spaceship landing pointy bit upwards and pretending to be the central keep.)
DOCTOR: It merges into the culture, tries to keep a low profile, so no one notices. That explains the robot knights. But the engines. The engines are damaged. They're leaking radiation into the local atmosphere, creating a temporary climate of staggering benevolence.
ROBIN: I beg pardon?
DOCTOR: I told you. It's too sunny. It's too green. And there is even an evil sheriff to oppress the locals. This explains everything, even you.
ROBIN: It does?
DOCTOR: Well, what does every oppressed peasant workforce need? The illusion of hope. Some silly story to get them through the day, lull them into docility, and keep them working. Ship's data banks. Full of every myth and legend you could hope for, including Robin Hood.
(The data bank displays various book illustrations and a photograph shows Robin Hood as played by Patrick Troughton.)
DOCTOR: Isn't it time you came clean with me? You're not real and you know it. Look at you. Perfect eyes, perfect teeth. Nobody has a jawline like that. You're as much a part of what is happening here as the Sheriff and his metal knights. You're a robot.
ROBIN: You dare to accuse me of collusion with that villain, the Sheriff?
DOCTOR: I dare.
ROBIN: You false-tongued knave. I should have skewered you when I had the chance.
DOCTOR: I would like to see you try.
(The metal door is blown inwards by lasers.)
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(The Sheriff enters with Clara and knights.)
SHERIFF: Surrender, outlaw.
DOCTOR: Very good.
SHERIFF: Kill him. Kill Robin Hood.
DOCTOR: You can drop all that stuff now, Sheriff.
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: He is not what you think he is. This is all play-acting.
CLARA: We can't just let them kill him!
DOCTOR: You're not fooling anyone, Sheriff.
(A blast from a knight knocks Robin off his feet. Clara gets between him and the attacker. Robin grabs her around the waist and they back up to a window.)
CLARA: What the hell are you doing?
ROBIN: Surviving.
CLARA: No!
(Robin falls backwards through the window, taking Clara with him.)
DOCTOR: No! Clara!
(Robin and Clara land in the moat. The full moon is reflected in the rippling water.)
SHERIFF: Yeah, sorry about the girl. Such a pretty thing. What a queen she would have made.
(The Sheriff turns away. The Doctor sees Robin climb out of the other side of the moat with Clara in his arms.)
DOCTOR: Stop pretending. You and your fancy robots. I get it. I understand.
SHERIFF: Oh, so you too know my plans?
DOCTOR: You and your robots plundering the surrounding countryside for all it's worth. Gold. Gold. Of course. Gold. You are creating a matrix of gold to repair the engine circuitry.
SHERIFF: This is the scheme the Mechanicals have devised. Soon this skyship will depart. Destination, London. There I will obliterate the King and take my rightful place as ruler of this sceptred isle.
DOCTOR: It won't work. There's not a chance. I've seen the instruments. There's been too much damage. You are stoking up a gigantic bomb!
SHERIFF: Shush.
(A knight knocks the Doctor out.)

[Castle]

KNIGHT [OC]: Engine capacity at forty eight percent.
(Knights carry a gold circuit board away. The Doctor wakes up.)
KNIGHT [OC]: Engine capacity at forty eight percent.
DOCTOR: It's not enough. That's not enough. It'll never make orbit.
(Amongst the wails and groans of downtrodden humanity there is a mechanical whumph!)
DOCTOR: That's the engines, building in power. Stupid, stupid Sheriff.
(He strains at the chains holding his wrists behind his back.)
DOCTOR: Argh! Go on, give! Give, you stupid things. What are you looking at?
(It is Quayle's ward.)

[Outlaw's hideout]

(Next morning, Clara wakes to the sight of Robin's face.)
CLARA: Hi.
ROBIN: The time for games is over.

[Castle]

QUAYLES WARD: I think I understand you. The Sheriff's using the gold to replace something.
DOCTOR: That's the principle. But he's a moron. If he tries to fly this ship, it'll explode and wipe out half the country. What we need is a little riot. Time to reflect on lasers and gold. Spread the word.
(Quayle's ward frees the Doctor's hands.)

[Outlaw's hideout]

ROBIN: You will tell me everything this Doctor knows about Robin Hood and his Merry Men.
CLARA: What is this? Why are you interrogating me?
ROBIN: And then, you will tell me exactly who this Doctor is and what are his plans.

[Castle]

KNIGHT: You are fit for labour. Stand aside while this peasant unit is freed.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're a little late.
KNIGHT: Explain.
DOCTOR: I'm already free!
(The knight powers up his violet beam. The Doctor reflects it with a golden plate and it hits the wall. Quayle's ward produces another plate and this time it is bounced straight back at the knight. It's head explodes. More knights come, but all the workers have plates for shields.)

[Sheriff's room]

(The Sheriff is annotating a map of England.)
SHERIFF: Mine, mine, mine.
KNIGHT: Engine capacity at seventy five percent.
(There is a beeping noise. The Sheriff pushes the papers aside to reveal a monitor in the wooden table. He watches the carnage that is taking place.)
SHERIFF: 'Ods blood! Who will rid me of this turbulent Doctor?
(He punches a knight. It hurts.)
SHERIFF: Come.

[Castle]

(People are screaming and dying, but so are the knights.)
DOCTOR: Everyone, the last one!
(It is surrounded by reflective surfaces. Its violet energy beam bounces around a lot until if finally returns to sender, multiplied several times. KaBOOM! Celebrations.)
DOCTOR: Out, out! Everyone, quickly, get out. Quickly!
QUAYLES WARD: You've saved us all, clever one.
(She kissees him on the cheek.)
QUAYLES WARD: Thank you.
KNIGHT: Engine capacity at eighty two percent.
SHERIFF: You are indeed an ingenious fellow, Doctor. But do you really think your peasants' revolt can stop me?
DOCTOR: I rather think you're the revolting one around here. I'm bantering. I'm bantering. Listen to me. You don't have enough gold content to seal the engine breach. If you try and take off, you'll wipe out half of England.
SHERIFF: Liar! From my sky vessel, I shall rule omnipotent.
DOCTOR: You pudding-headed primitive, shut down the engines. What you're doing will alter the course of history.
SHERIFF: I sincerely hope so, or I wouldn't be bothering.
(The Sheriff throws a knight's head into the crucible.)
DOCTOR: Listen to me. It doesn't have to end like this. Shut it all down, return Clara to me and I'll do what I can.
SHERIFF: I don't have Clara.
DOCTOR: Robin's one of yours.
SHERIFF: What did you say?
DOCTOR: He's one of your tin-headed puppets, just like these brutes here.
SHERIFF: Robin Hood is not one of mine.
DOCTOR: Of course he is. He's a robot, created by your mechanical mates.
SHERIFF: Why would they do that?
DOCTOR: To pacify the locals, give them false hope. He's the opiate of the masses.
SHERIFF: Why would we create an enemy to fight us? What sense would that make? That would be a terrible idea.
DOCTOR: Yes! Yes, it would. Wouldn't it? Yes, that would be a rubbish idea. Why would you do that? But he can't be. He's not real. He's a legend!
ROBIN: Too kind! And this legend does not come alone.
(Robin is up in the gallery.)
CLARA: Hiya!
(Robin sticks his dagger into a wall hanging and slides down with Clara holding on to him.)
ROBIN: You all right?
CLARA: Hell, yeah.
ROBIN: Good. My men have taken the castle.
SHERIFF: No!
ROBIN: Now I'm going to take you.
SHERIFF: This one's all mine.
(The two knights guarding the Sheriff are deactivated by the amulet hanging around his neck.)
SHERIFF: What do you say, outlaw? A final reckoning?
ROBIN: Oh, yes.
(Robin and the Sheriff prepare to sword-fight.)
DOCTOR: Are you okay?
CLARA: Fine, yeah.
DOCTOR: Good. We don't have long.
(The keep is rumbling and shaking.)
SHERIFF: I shall avenge every slight, outlaw.
CLARA: Doctor
DOCTOR: I know. The whole castle's about to blow.
SHERIFF: You have long been a thorn in my side.
ROBIN: Well, everyone should have a hobby. Mine's annoying you.
SHERIFF: I'll have you boiled in oil at the castle by sunset.
ROBIN: Can we make it a little earlier? Cos that's a little past my bedtime.
(Robin cuts a rope and flies on it up to a cross-beam.)
SHERIFF: I'm too much for you, outlaw. The first of a new breed. Half man, half engine.
(The Sheriff also does the rope thing and they continue the fight up on the beam.)
SHERIFF: Never ageing. Never tiring.
ROBIN: Are you still talking?
(The Sheriff cuts Robin's arm and he drops his sword. Then he opens his arms just like the Doctor did at the stream.)
SHERIFF: Bow down before your new king, you prince of knaves!
(The Sheriff comes at Robin, who turns so they are back to back then kicks the back of the Sheriff's knee.)
SHERIFF: Argh!
(The Sheriff falls into the crucible. Robin descends to the ground by rope again.)
ROBIN: Sorry. Was that, er, was that showing off?
CLARA: That was amazing.
(The castle shakes. Masonry starts to fall.)
DOCTOR: Run! Come on, run!
(We leave a pair of gold-covered hands sticking out of the crucible.)

[Castle grounds]

(From across the moat, we watch masonry fall and the spaceship take off.)
DOCTOR: It's never going to make it. Not enough gold. It'll never make it into orbit. Where is it? Where did it go?
CLARA: Where did what go?
DOCTOR: The golden arrow.
ROBIN: Tuck!
DOCTOR: You took it?
TUCK: Of course we did. We're robbers.
DOCTORY: I love you boys.
CLARA: Doctor, what are you suggesting?
DOCTOR: Golden arrow. It might just be enough gold content to get the ship into orbit and out of harm's way.
(The Doctor offers Robin the bow and arrow.)
ROBIN: No, it has to be you. My arm is injured.
(But the Doctor can't even get the arrow onto the bowstring.)
CLARA: You're good at this. I saw you. You won the tournament.
DOCTOR: I cheated. I made a special arrow with a homing device.
CLARA: Oh, brilliant. Right, let me have a go.
DOCTOR: You? You do Tae Kwon Do. That's not the same thing as this.
ROBIN: My friends. Surely we can manage it together?

[Spaceship]

KNIGHT: Engine capacity at eighty three percent. Insufficient power to achieve escape velocity.
(Sitting on the ground, the Doctor and Clara hold each end of the bow while Robin braces it with his foot. He pulls back the bowstring and releases the golden arrow. It hits the spaceship directly in the middle of a roundel on an engine.)
KNIGHT: Maximum power surge.
(The spaceship blasts into orbit.)
KNIGHT: Engines critical. Engines critical. Engines crit

[Castle grounds]

(KaBOOM! The watching crowd cheers.)
ALAN: (sings) One awful day in Nottingham, Brave Robin Hood was in a jam. The arrow flew it true
(His lute is snatched from him.)
WILL: Give it a rest, Alan.
ALAN: Give me my lute!
CLARA: Still not keen on the laughing thing?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no.
(Clara laughs. Robin laughs.)

[By a stream]

(Robin gives Clara a very personal archery lesson.)
CLARA: Woo-hoo! I'm going to miss you. You're very naughty.
ROBIN: Oh, I know. Whoever he is, he is a very lucky man.
CLARA: Marian is very lucky, too.
ROBIN: I fear not.
CLARA: Don't give up. Not ever. Not for one single day.
(She kisses his cheek.)
CLARA: Be safe, if you can be. But always be amazing.
ROBIN: Hmm.
CLARA: Goodbye, Robin Hood.
ROBIN: Goodbye, Clara Oswald.
(Clara winks at him, then goes into the Tardis.)
ROBIN: So, is it true, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Is what true?
ROBIN: That in the future I am forgotten as a real man? I am but a legend?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it is.
ROBIN: Hmm. Good. History is a burden. Stories can make us fly.
DOCTOR: I'm still having a little trouble believing yours, I'm afraid.
ROBIN: Is it so hard to credit? That a man born into wealth and privilege should find the plight of the oppressed and weak too much to bear...
DOCTOR: No.
ROBIN: Until one night he is moved to steal a Tardis? Fly among the stars, fighting the good fight. Clara told me your stories.
DOCTOR: She should not have told you any of that.
ROBIN: Well. Well, once the story started, she could hardly stop herself. You are her hero, I think.
DOCTOR: I'm not a hero.
ROBIN: Well, neither am I. But if we both keep pretending to be. Ha-ha! Perhaps others will be heroes in our name. Perhaps we will both be stories. And may those stories never end.
(They shake hands.)
ROBIN: Goodbye, Doctor, Time Lord of Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Robin Hood, Earl of Loxley.
ROBIN: And remember, Doctor. I'm just as real as you are.

[Tardis]

CLARA: Admit it. You like him.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm leaving him a present, aren't I?

[By a stream]

((Robin looks at a woman's portrait in a locket around his neck, as the Tardis dematerialises to reveal that same young woman has been standing behind it.)
QUAYLES WARD: Robin? I've found you at last.
ROBIN: Marian?  Thank you. Thank you, Doctor!
(He fires an arrow in the air, it comes to rest I know not where.)
ROBIN: Ha-ha-ha!


(The Doctor is on a world tour. First we see him sitting on top of the Tardis above the Earth.)
DOCTOR: (sotto) Listen!

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Question. Why do we talk out loud when we know we're alone? (blows out candle) Conjecture. Because we know we're not.
(He writes on his blackboard.)
DOCTOR: Evolution perfects survival skills. There are perfect hunters.
(He watches a lioness bring down a wildebeest.)
DOCTOR: There is perfect defence.
(A shoal of dazzling tuna, and a puffer fish inflates itself so the nasty spines stick out.)
DOCTOR: Question. Why is there no such thing as perfect hiding? Answer. How would you know? Logically, if evolution were to perfect a creature whose primary skill were to hide from view, how could you know it existed?
(He puts his chalk down in an open book.)
DOCTOR: It could be with us every second and we would never know. How would you detect it, even sense it, except in those moments when, for no clear reason you choose to speak aloud? What would such a creature want? What would it do? Well? What would you do?
(That last word echoes around the Tardis. The chalk is no longer where he left it. It rolls on the floor to his feet and he picks it up, then sees that what he wrote on the blackboard has been replaced by one word. Listen.)

[Restaurant]

(Clara has returned home, and is recalling the evening. We jump back to where she has been. Clara enters the restaurant and goes to the table where Danny Pink is sitting, wearing a pink shirt. He raises his right arm in a sort of open hand semi-salute.)
DANNY: Hey.
CLARA: Hey.
(She goes to shake his hand.)
CLARA: Sorry.
(They exchange kisses on the cheeks.)
CLARA: So the famous drink at last.
DANNY: Yeah. Took a bit of time, family stuff, but here we are.
CLARA: Dinner, in fact.
DANNY: Yeah, straight to dinner.
CLARA: I like a man who moves fast.
DANNY: Yeah? I might go straight for extras. Afters. Dessert.
CLARA: Yes, I know, I know, dessert.
DANNY: Straight to dessert.
CLARA: Gotcha.
DANNY: So, er, how was your day?
CLARA: Good. You know. Teaching.
DANNY: Yep, teaching.
CLARA: Teaching, teaching.
DANNY: Totally teaching.
CLARA: We probably shouldn't talk about work.
DANNY: God, yeah.
CLARA: Though, do you take Courtney for anything?
(A little later they are still laughing.)
DANNY: Are you serious?
CLARA: She said she couldn't concentrate on her work, because my face was too wide.
DANNY: Wide?
CLARA: I could kill that girl some days.
DANNY: Me too.
CLARA: And from you, that means something.
DANNY: Sorry?
(The jovial atmosphere dissipates instantly. We see Clara at home, putting her high heels by the kettle.)
DANNY: I dug twenty three wells.
CLARA: I'm sorry?
DANNY: Twenty three wells. When I was a soldier. Twenty three.
CLARA: Okay. Good. Good wells.
DANNY: Yeah, they were good, actually.
 CLARA: I'm not doubting the quality of your wells.
DANNY: Whole villages saved. Actual towns full of people. People I didn't shoot. People I kept safe.
CLARA: Okay. Point taken. Seriously.
DANNY: So why doesn't that ever get mentioned?
CLARA: I'm sorry I didn't mention your twenty three wells.
WAITER: Excuse me?
CLARA: Sorry.
WAITER: Er, water for the table?
CLARA: Don't you worry. He'll probably dig for it.
(The waiter leaves with the jug of water. After a few moments, Danny laughs.)
DANNY: Sorry.
CLARA: It's okay.
DANNY: Sensitive subject.
CLARA: Yes. Can slightly see that.
DANNY: Sometimes people like you get the wrong end of the stick.
CLARA: People like me?
(In her apartment, Clara takes a sip of the hot drink she has made.)
DANNY: I wasn't making assumptions about you.
CLARA: That really is exactly what you were doing.
DANNY: You were making assumptions about me.
CLARA: I made a joke.
DANNY: A not-funny joke.
CLARA: Yeah, well, do you know what I'm making now?
DANNY: A fuss?
CLARA: An exit.
(Clara puts on her coat and leaves the restaurant. Danny thumps his head on the table.)

[Clara's bedroom]

(The door hits something as it opens. The Doctor is sitting at Clara's dressing table.)
DOCTOR: You just have to squeeze through.
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head?
CLARA: What are you doing in here?
DOCTOR: You said you had a date. I thought I'd better hide in the bedroom in case you brought him home. Bit early, aren't you? Did it all go wrong, or is this good by your standards?
CLARA: It was a disaster and I am extremely upset about it, since you didn't ask.
DOCTOR: Fine. I need you, for a thing.
CLARA: I can't.
DOCTOR: Oh, of course you can. Come on, you're free. More than usually free, in fact.
CLARA: No, it's just possible that I might get a phone call.
DOCTOR: From the date guy? It's too late. You've taken your make-up off.
CLARA: No, I haven't. I'm still wearing my make-up.
DOCTOR: Oh, right. Well, you probably just missed a bit. Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[Tardis]

(Clara is carrying her shoes.)
CLARA: I haven't actually said yes.
DOCTOR: Yes, you know sometimes when you talk to yourself, what if you're not?
CLARA: Not what?
DOCTOR: What if it's not you you're talking to? Proposition. What if no one is ever really alone? What if every single living being has a companion, a silent passenger, a shadow? What if the prickle on the back of your neck, is the breath of something close behind you?
CLARA: How long have you been travelling alone?
DOCTOR: Perhaps I never have.
(He shows her the blackboard with the word he didn't write.)
CLARA: It looks like your handwriting.
DOCTOR: Well, I couldn't have written it and forgotten, could I?
CLARA: Have you met you? What's all this?
(A table strewn with books.)
DOCTOR: Dreams. Accounts of dreams, by different people, all through history. You see, I have a theory.
CLARA: I'll bet you have. What theory?
DOCTOR: I think everybody, at some point in their lives, has the exact same nightmare. You wake up, or you think you do, and there's someone in the dark, someone close, or you think there might be.
(As evidenced by the little boy, the little girl, the old woman waking in their respective beds, putting on the light and sitting on the edge of the bed, feet on the floor.)
DOCTOR: So you sit up,and  turn on the light. And the room looks different at night. It ticks and creaks and breathes. And you tell yourself there's nobody there, nobody watching, nobody listening, nobody there at all. And you very nearly believe it. You really, really try and then.
(A hand reaches out from under the beds and grabs the left ankle.)
DOCTOR: There are accounts of that dream throughout human history. Time and time again, the same dream. Now, there is a very obvious question I'm about to ask you. Do you know what it is?
CLARA: Have you had that dream?
DOCTOR: Exactly.
CLARA: No, that was me asking you. Have you had that dream?
DOCTOR: I asked first.
CLARA: No, I did.
DOCTOR: You really didn't.
CLARA: Okay, yeah, probably. Yes. But everyone dreams about something under the bed.
DOCTOR: Why?
(The Doctor places Clara's fingers into squidgy sections on the Tardis console.)
DOCTOR: Just hold on tight. If anything bites, let it.
CLARA: What is it?
DOCTOR: Tardis telepathic interface. You are now in mental contact with the Tardis, so don't think anything rude.
CLARA: Why not?
DOCTOR: It might end up on all of the screens. The Tardis is extrapolating your entire timeline, from the moment of your birth, to the moment of your death.
CLARA: Which I do not need a preview of.
DOCTOR: I'm turning off the safeguards and navigation, slaving the Tardis to you. Focus on the dream. Focus on the details. Picture them, feel them. The Tardis will track on your subconscious and extract the relevant information. It should be able to home in on the moment in your timeline when you first had that dream. And then, we'll see.
CLARA: What will we see?
DOCTOR: What's under your bed.
(He starts the Tardis flying.)
CLARA: Ooo!
DOCTOR: Okay, now don't get distracted. Remember, you are flying a time machine.
(Clara's mobile phone rings, and the image of Danny greeting her at the restaurant flashes into her mind. As the Doctor walks around the console to her, he passes a blackboard with lots of items chalked on it, beginning with Evolution Perfects. It is what he wrote at the top of the show.)
DOCTOR: No, no. Don't you dare. No, don't. Don't, don't. Just ignore it.
(The Tardis lands.)
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. That worked. We're here.
CLARA: Sorry, I think I got distracted.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. The date's fine. Come on.
CLARA: Come on where?
DOCTOR: Your childhood.
(The Doctor leaves. Clara tugs hard to try and release her fingers from the Tardis interface. On the third try she is free to follow.)

[Outside the building]

(Night.)
DOCTOR: The West Country Children's Home. Gloucester. By the ozone level and the drains, mid-nineties. You must have been here when you had the dream.
CLARA: Never been to Gloucester in my life, and I've never lived in a children's home.
DOCTOR: You've probably just forgotten. Have you seen the size of human brains? They're hilarious. Little you must be in here somewhere, with your little brain.
CLARA: Isn't it bad if I meet myself?
DOCTOR: It is potentially catastrophic.
CLARA: So why did you bring me out here?
DOCTOR: I was still talking. I needed someone to nod. Probably best for you to wait in the Tardis.
CLARA: Doctor, I
DOCTOR: See you in a minute. Tardis.
CLARA: Doctor. If I had have been distracted, what would have happened?
DOCTOR: We would probably have ended up in the wrong place. But don't think we have, because the time zone's right. I won't be long.
(The Doctor walks away. A young boy waves from an upstairs window. He reminds Clara of how Danny waves. Then he opens his window and calls down.)
RUPERT: What are you doing down there?
CLARA: Nothing. Er, I'm just. What's your name?
RUPERT: Rupert.
CLARA: Oh. Okay. Hello, Rupert.
RUPERT: Rupert Pink. It's a stupid name.
CLARA: No, it isn't. I know somebody called Pink.
RUPERT: I meant Rupert. I'm going to change it.
CLARA: Why are you awake? Are you scared?

[Children's home]

(The sonic screwdriver is scanning as the Doctor walks along the corridor. A balding man in glasses opens a door. We hear the TV on in the background.)
REG: How did you get in?
DOCTOR: Your door must be faulty.
(The Doctor holds up his psychic paper.)
REG: An inspection? It's two in the morning.
DOCTOR: When better? Do you always work here nights?
REG: Most nights, yes.
DOCTOR: Do you ever end up talking to yourself?
REG: All the time. It's this place. You can't help it.
DOCTOR: What about your coffee?
REG: My coffee?
(Reg looks at the mug he put down on the table. We see Clara going up the stairs behind them.)
DOCTOR: Sometimes, do you put it down, and look round, and it's not there?
REG: Everybody does that.
DOCTOR: Yes. Everybody.
(The television switches off.)
DOCTOR: Who turned your telly off?
REG: It does that. It just goes off.
(The Doctor has vanished. Reg looks for his mug, but it has vanished too. The Doctor walks along the corridor and takes a drink from it.)
DOCTOR: Hmm.
(Clara opens a creaky door and walks along an upstairs corridor.)

[Rupert's room]

(Rupert is sitting on the floor by the window.)
CLARA: Hello.
RUPERT: Hello.
CLARA: Nice room. You know, you should have more than one chair. What do you do when people come round?
RUPERT: Sit on the bed.
CLARA: Why aren't you sitting on it, then? Do you think that there's something underneath it? Hey, everyone thinks that, sometimes. That's just how people think at night.
RUPERT: Why?
CLARA: Did you have a dream? A hand grabbing your foot? You have, haven't you? You've had that exact dream.
RUPERT: How did you know?
CLARA: Do you know why dreams are called dreams?
RUPERT: Why?
CLARA: Because they're not real. If they were, they wouldn't need a name.
RUPERT: What are you doing?
(Clara looks underneath the bed.)
CLARA: Do you know what's under there?
RUPERT: What?
CLARA: Me!
(Clara rolls under the bed and lies on her back.)
CLARA: Come on, It's perfectly safe.
(Rupert lies next to her.)
CLARA: See? Nobody here, except us.
RUPERT: Sometimes I hear noises.
CLARA: It's a house full of people. Of course you hear noises.
RUPERT: They're all asleep.
CLARA: They're all dreaming.
RUPERT: Can you hear dreams?
CLARA: If you're clever enough. But they can't harm you. You know, sometimes we think there's something behind us. And the space under your bed is what's behind you at night. Simple as that. There's nothing to be afraid of.
(The bed creaks as someone sits on it. It sags to within inches of Clara's nose. Rupert starts breathing quickly.)
CLARA: (sotto) Who else is in this room?
RUPERT: (sotto) Nobody.
CLARA: (sotto) Someone must have come in.
RUPERT: (sotto) Nobody came in.
(Clara rolls out and stands up. There is someone sitting on the bed, covered in the red crocheted bedspread.)
CLARA: Hello?
(She helps Rupert stand up.)
CLARA: Who's this? This is a friend of yours playing a game. Playing a trick, are you, hey? A little trick on Rupert here?
(The bed creaks as the figure shifts, sitting up taller.)
CLARA: Okay. It's not funny this, you know.
(The light is switched on. Clara and Rupert turn to see the Doctor sitting in the chair flicking through a book. The figure is still covered by the bedspread.)
DOCTOR: Where is he?
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: I can't find him. Can you find him?
CLARA: Find who?
DOCTOR: Wally.
CLARA: Wally?
DOCTOR: He's nowhere in this book.
RUPERT: It's not a Where's Wally one.
DOCTOR: Well, how would you know? Maybe you just haven't found him yet.
RUPERT: He's not in every book.
DOCTOR: Really? Well, that's a few years of my life I'll be needing back. Are you scared? The thing on the bed, whatever it is, look at it. Does it scare you?
RUPERT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well, that's good. Want to know why that's good?
RUPERT: Why?
DOCTOR: Let me tell you about scared. Your heart is beating so hard, I can feel it through your hands. There's so much blood and oxygen pumping through your brain, it's like rocket fuel. Right now, you could run faster and you could fight harder, you could jump higher than ever in your life. And you are so alert, it's like you can slow down time. What's wrong with scared? Scared is a superpower. It's your superpower. There is danger in this room and guess what? It's you. Do you feel it? Do you think he feels it? Do you think he's scared? Nah. Loser. Turn your back on him.
RUPERT: What?
DOCTOR: Yeah, turn your back on him. Come on. You too, Clara. Clara, your back, now.
(The Doctor turns and goes to the window.)
DOCTOR: Do it. Just do it now. Turn your back. Do it now, turn your back. Lovely view out this window.
(Rupert stands between them.)
CLARA: Yeah. Come and see all the dark.
DOCTOR: The deep and lovely dark. We'd never see the stars without it. Now, there are two possibilities. Possibility one, it's just one of your friends standing there, and he's playing a joke on you. Possibility two, it isn't.
CLARA: So, plan? Plans are good.
DOCTOR: You on the bed, I'm talking to you now. Go in peace. We won't look. Just go. If all you want to do is stay hidden, it's okay. Just leave.
(The figure moves up close behind them.)
CLARA: Is it gone?
DOCTOR: Don't look round. Not yet.
RUPERT: I can't hear anything.
DOCTOR: Don't look round.
(Rupert starts to turn around.)
DOCTOR: Look away! Look away now! Don't look at it! Don't look round. Don't look round. Don't look at the reflection.
RUPERT: What is it?
(The thing pulls the bedspread off, and we get a glimpse of an out of focus maybe-not-quite-human forehead and eyes.)
DOCTOR: Imagine a thing that must never be seen. What would it do if you saw it?
RUPERT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Neither do I. Close your eyes.
RUPERT: What?
DOCTOR: Close your eyes. You too, Clara. Give it what it wants. Prove to it that you're not going to look at it. Make a promise. A promise you're never going to look at it.
RUPERT: I promise never to look.
DOCTOR: The breath on the back of your neck, like your hair's standing on end. That means, don't look round.
(The door slams shut.)
CLARA: Gone.
DOCTOR: Gone.
RUPERT: He took my bedspread.
DOCTOR: Oh, the human race. You're never happy, are you?
RUPERT: Am I safe now?
(Clara and the Doctor look at Rupert's toys. The Doctor is interested in his orange robot.)
DOCTOR: Nobody's safe, especially not at night in the dark, Anything can get you. And all the way up here, you're up here all alone.
(Clara slaps the back of the Doctor's head.)
DOCTOR: What was that for?
CLARA: Shut up, leave this to me.
(She has found a box of toy plastic soldiers.)
CLARA: These yours?
RUPERT: They're the home's.
CLARA: They're yours now.
DOCTOR: People don't need to be lied to.
CLARA: People don't need to be scared by a big gray-haired stick insect, but here you are. Stay still, shut up. See what I'm doing? This is your army.
(Clara puts the little soldiers on guard around Rupert's bed.)
DOCTOR: Plastic army.
CLARA: Sit! And they're going to guard under your bed. You see this one? This is the boss one, the colonel. He's going to keep a special eye out.
RUPERT: It's broken, that one. It doesn't have a gun.
CLARA: That's why he's the boss. A soldier so brave he doesn't need a gun. He can keep the whole world safe. What shall we call him?
RUPERT: Dan.
CLARA: Sorry?
RUPERT: Dan, the soldier man. That's what I call him.
CLARA: Good. Good name.
RUPERT: Yeah. Would you read me a story? It'll help me get to sleep.
CLARA: Sure.
DOCTOR: Once upon a time.
(He touches Rupert's forehead and the boy falls back, asleep.)
DOCTOR: The end. Dad skills.
(After all, if you're a grandfather, you've probably been a father first.)

[Tardis]

CLARA: So is it possible we've just saved that kid from another kid in a bedspread?
DOCTOR: Entirely possible, yes. The bigger question is, why did we end up with him, and not you?
CLARA: I got distracted.
DOCTOR: But why that particular boy? You don't have any. You don't have any kind of connection with him, do you?
CLARA: No. No, no, no. Of course not. Why do you ask?
(The Doctor is working on a Tardis component.)
DOCTOR: The Tardis was slaved to your timeline. Theoretically, there should have been some connection.
CLARA: Will er, will he remember any of that?
DOCTOR: Scrambled his memory. Gave him a big old dream about being Dan the soldier man.
(Clara starts crying.)
DOCTOR: Are you okay?
CLARA: Doctor, I am sorry to ask, and, you know, I realise this is probably against the laws of time, or summat. Er, could you do me a favour?

[Outside the restaurant]

(Clara leaves the restaurant, and Danny bangs his head on the table. The Doctor and Clara step out of the Tardis.)
CLARA: Is that what I look like from the back?
DOCTOR: It's fine.
CLARA: I was thinking it was good.
DOCTOR: Really?
(Clara walks to the restaurant.)

[Restaurant]

(She sits down opposite Danny, who raises his head from the table.)
CLARA: Sorry.
DANNY: Hey.
(Clara holds out her hand.)
CLARA: Hello. I'm Clara Oswald. I'm a bit tricky, sometimes a bit up myself, and I do not like my surname, but I think that's basically everything you need to worry about.
(He takes her hand.)
DANNY: Hello, I'm. I'm sorry
CLARA: Also, I mouth off when I'm nervous and I've got a mouth on me. Seriously, it's got a mind of its own. I'm really worried it wants to go solo.
DANNY: I don't know what to say.
CLARA: Don't say anything. Or say something nice.
DANNY: I like your name.
CLARA: It's a start.
DANNY: Oswald. It suits you.
CLARA: Drifting now.
DANNY: Yeah, it's better than Pink.
CLARA: No, Pink, Pink is nice. I like pink.
DANNY: You can have it.
CLARA: Ooo, a bold offer, Mister Pink.
DANNY: I meant. You, no
CLARA: I know, I know.
DANNY: Why can't I speak today?
CLARA: It's that foot you're keeping in your mouth.
DANNY: Is that where I put it?
CLARA: Anyway. Clara Pink. Too much.
DANNY: Yeah, it is a bit much.
CLARA: Mind you, Rupert Pink.
(In the background, someone drops a glass and it breaks.)
DANNY: Sorry?
CLARA: Er, ha, ha. Rupert Pink. It's not good.
DANNY: Rupert?
CLARA: Yeah. That was your name, yeah?
DANNY: Who told you that?
CLARA: Er, someone in the school.
(She looks away and clucks her tongue against her palate.)
DANNY: No, I haven't used that name for years.
CLARA: I cannot remember who it was.
DANNY: Are you making fun of me?
CLARA: No. No, no, no. No way.
DANNY: Is this a joke?
CLARA: Danny, nothing about this is any kind of joke.
(The door to the kitchens creaks opens and a spaceman walks in.)
DANNY: Where's your coat?
CLARA: My what?
DANNY: You put your coat on when you left.
CLARA: Er, I'm really sorry. Danny. There is something I should probably be honest about.
DANNY: How about everything?
CLARA: Everything, in my case, is actually quite a lot.
DANNY: Well, that's weird.
CLARA: No, no, no, it's not weird. Not really Where are you going?
DANNY: I don't do weird.
CLARA: Don't go.
DANNY: Then do something for me, Tell me the truth, because I know when people are lying to me. However weird this thing may be, just tell me the truth.
CLARA: It's not weird
(Clara sees the spaceman beckoning to her.)
CLARA: Exactly.
(The Tardis is visible as the spaceman returns to the kitchen.)
DANNY: I've had enough.
(Danny leaves. Clara sighs, then heads to the kitchens.)

[Tardis]

(She slams the door shut and talks to the spaceman.)
CLARA: I am trying to have a date. A real life, inter-human actual date! It's a normal nice, everyday, meeting-up sort of thing. And I would just like to know, is there any other way you can make this any more surreal than it already is?
(The spaceman takes off his helmet. He is a total dead ringer for Danny Pink, but with bigger hair and a fuller beard.)
ORSON: Hello.
DOCTOR: Ah, Clara! Well done, you found her. Now this is really a bit strange.
CLARA: Danny?
DOCTOR: What's gone wrong with your face? It's all eyes! Why are you all eyes? Get them under control.
ORSON: Er, who's Danny?
DOCTOR: This is Colonel Orson Pink, from about a hundred years in your future.
CLARA: Orson Pink?
DOCTOR: Yeah, I laughed too. Sorry. Do you have any connection with him?
CLARA: Connection?
DOCTOR: Yes, maybe you're like a distant relative or something?
CLARA: How, how would I know?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. (to Orson) Er, well, do you have any old family photographs of her? You know, probably quite old and really fat-looking?
ORSON: I don't.
CLARA: How did you find him?
DOCTOR: Well, you left a trace in the Tardis telepathic circuits. I fired them up again and the Tardis brought me straight to him. So he is something to do with your timeline.
CLARA: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you'll never guess where I found him.

[Capsule]

(A spaceship is sitting on a rocky planet with a massive hemisphere of a sun dominating the horizon. Calling it a time capsule implies it is much smaller than it really is.)
CLARA: Where are we?
DOCTOR: The end of the road. This is it, the end of everything. The last planet.
CLARA: The end of the universe?
DOCTOR: The Tardis isn't supposed to come this far, but some idiot turned the safeguards off. Listen.
CLARA: To what?
DOCTOR: Nothing. There's nothing to hear. There's nothing anywhere. Not a breath, not a slither, not a click or a tick. All the clocks have stopped. This is the silence at the end of time.
(A clattering as Orson empties the contents of a locker into a rucksack.)
CLARA: Then how did he get here? If he's from a hundred years in my future
DOCTOR: Pioneer time traveller.
(The Doctor sonicks the records up on the computer. The BBC is still using the same Breaking News ticker at the bottom of the screen.)
DOCTOR: Rode the first of the great time shots. They were supposed to fire him into the middle of the next week.
CLARA: What happened?
DOCTOR: He went a bit far.
CLARA: A bit?
DOCTOR: A big bit. Look at him now. Robinson Crusoe at the end of time itself. The last man standing in the universe. I always thought that would be me.
CLARA: It's not a competition.
DOCTOR: I know it's not a competition. Course it isn't. Still time, though.
CLARA: He looks like he's packing.
DOCTOR: He's been stranded for six months, just met a time traveller. Of course he's packing.
(Orson enters.)
ORSON: You can do it, then? You can get me home?
DOCTOR: I just showed you, didn't I? A test flight to a restaurant.
ORSON: Yes, but to my family, to my own time?
DOCTOR: Easy. I can do that, can't I, Clara?
CLARA: He can, yes.
ORSON: Is everything okay?
CLARA: Yeah, fine. I'm fine.
ORSON: Do I know you?
CLARA: No. Nope.
DOCTOR: Is she doing the all eyes thing? It's because her face is so wide. She needs three mirrors.
CLARA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: We can't leave immediately, though. The Tardis needs to recharge.
CLARA: Sorry. What?
DOCTOR: Overnight, that should do it, shouldn't it, Clara?
ORSON: Overnight?
DOCTOR: One more night. That's, that's not a problem, is it?
(Orson's face says yes, but -)
ORSON: No. No, no problem.
DOCTOR: It's a shame, isn't it?
ORSON: What's a shame?
DOCTOR: There's only three people left in the universe, and you're lying to the other two. It was the first thing I noticed when I stepped in here. You must have seen it, too, Clara. You've got eyes out to here.
CLARA: Seen what?
DOCTOR: The universe is dead. Everything that ever was is dead and gone. There's nothing beyond this door but nothingness for ever. So why is it locked?
ORSON: Please, don't make me spend another night here.
DOCTOR: Afraid of the dark? But the dark is empty now.
ORSON: No. No, it isn't.

[Tardis]

(Clara wears the rucksack, Orson carrys two metal cases. She leads him down below the time rotor level.)
CLARA: You'll be safe in here. Nothing gets through those doors, I promise.
ORSON: And you two are going to wait out there?
CLARA: That would seem to be the plan. Wait for what exactly?
ORSON: Why can't we just leave?
CLARA: Like he said, it's recharging.
ORSON: You didn't look like you believed him.
CLARA: That's just how my face looks when he talks.
(A clear plastic box containing a gun-less plastic soldier falls from Orson's backpack when she puts it down. Clara picks it up.)
ORSON: It's just a silly toy thing. A family heirloom, supposed to bring good luck.
CLARA: Right. Yes. Didn't do a very good job, did it?
ORSON: It did. You're here, aren't you? What were the chances of you two finding me?
CLARA: Orson, do me a favour. Take my advice. When you get home, stay away from time travel.
(She gives him the toy back.)
ORSON: It runs in the family.
CLARA: What? Sorry, what do you mean, runs in the family?
ORSON: Nothing. It's just silly stories one of my grandparents. well, great-grandparents
CLARA: What is it? Tell me. You asked if you knew me. It's a family heirloom?
(Orson holds Dan the soldier man out to her and they hold hands around it.)
ORSON: Yeah.

[Capsule]

CLARA: What are we doing?
DOCTOR: Waiting.
CLARA: For what? For who? If everybody in the universe is dead, then there's nobody out there.
DOCTOR: That's one way of looking at it.
CLARA: What's the other?
DOCTOR: That's a hell of a lot of ghosts.
(The lights dim.)
CLARA: Do you have your own mood lighting now? Because, frankly, the accent is enough.
(The capsule creaks. Words appear on the main hatch - Do Not Open The Door.)
CLARA: Where did that come from?
DOCTOR: It's always been there. It's only visible in the night lights.
CLARA: But who wrote it?
DOCTOR: Colonel Pink. Apparently, at night, he needs a reminder. Six months stranded alone, I suppose it must be tempting.
CLARA: What is?
DOCTOR: Company.
(More slow creaking.)
CLARA: What's that?
DOCTOR: What kind of explanation would you like?
CLARA: A reassuring one?
DOCTOR: Well, the systems are switching to low power. There are temperature differentials all over this ship. It's like pipes banging when the heating goes off.
CLARA: Always thought there was something in the pipes.
DOCTOR: Me, too. Who were you having dinner with?
CLARA: Are you making conversation?
DOCTOR: I thought that I would give it a try.
CLARA: I told you. A date.
DOCTOR: Serious?
CLARA: It's a date.
DOCTOR: A serious date?
CLARA: Do I have to bring him to you for approval?
DOCTOR: Well, I would like to know about his prospects. If you like, I can pop ahead and check them out.
CLARA: Frankly, you've already done enough.
(What sounds like a scream makes them jump.)
DOCTOR: Atmospheric pressure equalising
CLARA: Or?
DOCTOR: Company.
CLARA: Why are we doing this? Why don't we just go?
DOCTOR: Because I need to know.
CLARA: Why? About what?
DOCTOR: Suppose that there are creatures that live to hide. That only show themselves to the very young or the very old, or the mad, or anyone who wouldn't be believed.
CLARA: Okay, so
DOCTOR: What would those creatures do when everyone was gone? When there was only one man left standing in the universe?
(Bang, bang, bang.)
CLARA: What's that?
DOCTOR: Potentially, the hull cooling.
CLARA: Potentially?
DOCTOR: Believably.
(Bang, bang, bang.)
DOCTOR: Someone knocking.
(Bang, bang, bang.)
DOCTOR: Yes.
(Bang, bang, bang. Scrape, scrape, scrape.)
CLARA: Doctor,
(Bang, bang, bang.)
CLARA: You don't actually believe all this, do you? Hiding creatures, things from under the bed.
(Bang, bang, bang. Scrape, scrape, scrape.)
DOCTOR: What's that in the mirror, or the corner of your eye? What's that footstep following, but never passing by?
(Bang, bang, bang.)
CLARA: Did we come to the end of the universe because of a nursery rhyme?
(Bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang. The Doctor sonicks the hatch to Unlocked. The mechanism starts to turn.)
CLARA: That's you turning it, right?
DOCTOR: No. Get in the Tardis.
CLARA: Why?
DOCTOR: I have to know.
CLARA: Doctor. Doctor
DOCTOR: The Tardis, now!
CLARA: Okay, okay. Somebody is out there. Now we know, we can leave. Oh, Doctor!
DOCTOR: It's a pressure lock. Releasing it could've triggered the opening mechanism.
CLARA: Is there even an atmosphere out there?
DOCTOR: There is an air shell round the ship. Why are you still here?
CLARA: Because I am not going to leave you in danger!
DOCTOR: Then you will never travel with me again, because that is the deal! Tardis, now! Do as you are told!
(Clara runs to the Tardis.)
CLARA: You're an idiot.
(She goes inside.)
DOCTOR: I know.

[Tardis]

ORSON: What's happening?
CLARA: He's opening the door.

[Capsule]

DOCTOR: Perhaps they're all just waiting, perhaps when we're all dead, out they'll come a-slithering from underneath the bed.
(The airlock opens.)

[Tardis]

CLARA: Oh, no, no, no, not now, come on!
(The scanner flickers as the air starts to leave the capsule..)
CLARA: Oh! Always when it's important!
(The Tardis jolts.)
CLARA: What's happening?
(A klaxon sounds.)
CLARA: What's that?
ORSON: The alarm. The air shell's breached. Stay here.
(The scanner flickers on to show the Doctor hanging on to the edge of a console as the air and anything loose is sucked out of the capsule. A gloved hand grabs his wrist as he starts to slip and he is pulled to safety. A short time later, the unconscious Doctor is back in the Tardis.)
CLARA: Is he okay?
ORSON: He's out cold. He'll be fine, though.
CLARA: Something hit him.
ORSON: Everything was flying out of that door.
CLARA: Could've been that.
ORSON: Yeah.
(We still hear a group of three sounds repeating in the background.)
CLARA: What was out there? What were you so afraid of?
ORSON: I've been here a long time. My own shadow, probably.
CLARA: Yeah.
(Rumble. The Tardis doors move slightly.)
ORSON: That's probably just the rest of the air escaping.
CLARA: You say probably a lot.
(Creak, whumph!)
ORSON: We are safe? Nothing can get in here, right?
CLARA: Probably.
(A hissing sound, like air escaping? The Cloister Bell tolls. Clara goes to the console.)
ORSON: Have you got a plan?
CLARA: Telepathic circuits. I left a trace in them before.
ORSON: So?
CLARA: So apparently, that can do a thing.
(She sticks her fingers into the console again.)
ORSON: What, that's your plan?
CLARA: It's not a plan, it's a thing.
(The time rotor starts to stutter.)
CLARA: (sotto) Okay. Come on, come on, you can do it!
(The Doctor wheezes.)
CLARA: Come on! Sorry.
(The time rotor gets up to speed.)
CLARA: Here we go! Come on. Come on!
(The Tardis lands with a thump. The Cloister Bell has stopped and there are no more three part bangs on the sound track.)
ORSON: Is that it?
CLARA: I don't know. I think so.
(The scanner isn't much help.)
ORSON: Where are we?
CLARA: Somewhere else. I hope. No, no, no, you stay and look after the Doctor.
ORSON: You can't go out there by yourself.
CLARA: Thing is, my timeline, it keeps on. Orson, you don't want to meet yourself. It's really embarrassing.

[Barn]

(The Tardis door creaks slightly as Clara closes it. On a raised platform is a simple bed, and a child is lying curled up on their side under a blanket, sobbing as the star and/or moonlight streams down through the roof. Clara climbs the ladder to the platform.)
CLARA: Rupert?
(She walks to the bed.)
CLARA: Orson?
(The barn door opens and we see two pairs of feet enter. The woman wears a long skirt with an apron over the top.)
MAN: Why does he have to sleep out here?
WOMAN: He doesn't want the others to hear him crying.
MAN: Why does he have to cry all the time?
(Clara hides under the bed.)
WOMAN: You know why.
MAN: There'll be no crying in the army.
WOMAN: Hush.
MAN: Don't pretend you're not awake. We're not idiots.
WOMAN: Come and sleep in the house. You don't have to be alone. If you can hear me, you're very welcome in the house, with the other boys. I'll leave the door on the latch. Come in any time.
MAN: He can't just run away crying all the time if he wants to join the army.
WOMAN: He doesn't want to join the army. I keep telling you.
MAN: Well, he's not going to the Academy, is he, that boy? He'll never make a Time Lord.

[Tardis]

(The Doctor wakes suddenly.)
DOCTOR: Sontarans! Perverting the course of human history! 
ORSON: (sotto) Doctor?
DOCTOR: You're confusing me. What? Shut up, shut up. Where's Clara?

[Barn]

DOCTOR [OC]: Clara! Clara!
BOY: Hello? Who's there? Hello?
(The boy sits on the edge of his bed, and Clara grabs his ankle as if by reflex.)
CLARA: It's okay. This is just a dream. Just lie back again. Just lie back on the bed. It will all be okay if you just lie down and go to sleep. Just do that for me. Just sleep.
(She releases his ankle and the boy gets back into bed. Clara sits on the edge of the bed and puts her hand on his head, stroking his hair gently as he sobs to himself. She whispers into his ear.)
CLARA: Listen

[Tardis]

ORSON: What happened? What did you see? What's out there?
(Clara returns.)
CLARA: What if there was nothing? What if there never was anything? Nothing under the bed, nothing at the door. What if the big bad Time Lord doesn't want to admit he's just afraid of the dark.
DOCTOR: Where are we? Have we moved? Where have we landed?
CLARA: Don't look where we are. Take off, and promise me you will never look where we've been.
DOCTOR: Why?
CLARA: Just take off. Don't ask questions.
DOCTOR: I don't take orders, Clara.
CLARA: Do as you're told.
(The Tardis dematerialises. The boy sits up in his bed.)
CLARA [OC]: Listen

[Barn]

(Earlier, whispering into his ear. We are also shown Orson being returned home, and giving Clara a hug.)
CLARA: This is just a dream. But very clever people can hear dreams. So, please, just listen. I know you're afraid, but being afraid is all right. Because didn't anybody ever tell you? Fear is a superpower. Fear can make you faster and cleverer and stronger. And one day, you're going to come back to this barn. And on that day you're going to be very afraid indeed.
(The new 9th / War Doctor or Warrior as I called him, stands in the wilderness looking at the lonely barn, taken from the Day of the Doctor.)
CLARA: But that's okay. Because if you're very wise and very strong, fear doesn't have to make you cruel or cowardly.

[Tardis]

CLARA [OC]: Fear can make you kind.
(Clara grabs the Doctor from behind for a hug.)
DOCTOR: No, no. Not the hugging. No, no, no. I'm against the hugging. Please.

[Danny's flat]

(The Doctor drops Clara off and leaves. Danny's doorbell rings, so he goes and answers it.)
DANNY: I am so
CLARA: I know.

[Barn]

CLARA: It doesn't matter if there's nothing under the bed or in the dark, so long as you know it's okay to be afraid of it.

[Danny's flat]

DANNY: And I just get nervous.
CLARA: Me too.
DANNY: I don't even know what I'm nervous of.
(Over images of the Doctor underlining at the word Listen on his blackboard.)
CLARA [OC]: I'll show you. So, listen. If you listen to nothing else, listen to this.

[Barn]

CLARA: You're always going to be afraid, even if you learn to hide it. Fear is like a companion. A constant companion, always there. But that's okay, because fear can bring us together.
(Clara kisses Danny.)
CLARA: Fear can bring you home. I'm going to leave you something, just so you'll always remember, fear makes companions of us all.
(Clara leaves Dan the soldier man to stand guard as she says what the Doctor told Barbara while they were tied up in the Cave of Skulls. - Unearthly Child episode 3.)


[Clara's flat]
(The Tardis is parked in the living room for a change. The Doctor is in the tiny kitchen watching Clara's washing spinning in the machine whilst she checks her makeup in the dressing table mirror. We are treated to a view of his face also going round and round with the garments.)
DOCTOR: The Satanic Nebula.
(He looks at the little goldfish in the bowl on the counter.)
DOCTOR: Or the lagoon of lost stars. Or we could go to Brighton. I've got a whole day worked out.
CLARA: Sorry, but as you can see, I've got plans.
(Clara is in an open-necked white blouse with a thin black tie knotted halfway down her chest, black trousers with stilletto heels and is putting on a black jacket.)
DOCTOR: Have you?
CLARA: Look at me.
DOCTOR: Yeah, okay.
CLARA: No, no, no. No. Look at me.
DOCTOR: Yep, looking.
CLARA: Seriously?
DOCTOR: Why is your face all coloured in?

[Classroom - memory]

DANNY: 7.15. Meeting me. You are. Date. Second one.
CLARA: Got the words out. Not in the right order, but, hey. Maths teacher.
(A young boy enters just as they are leaning in for a kiss.)
BOTH: Out.

[Clara's flat]

DOCTOR: Are you taller?
CLARA: Heels.
DOCTOR: What, do you have to reach a high shelf?
CLARA: Right, got to go. Going to be late.
DOCTOR: For a shelf?
CLARA: Bye.
(A proper, old-fashioned telephone rings. It is the emergency one in the Tardis.)
CLARA: There you go, you've got another playmate.
DOCTOR: Hardly anyone in the universe has that number.
CLARA: Well, I've got it.
DOCTOR: Yes, from some woman in a shop. We still don't know who that was.
CLARA: Is that her now?
DOCTOR: There are very few people that it could be.
(He goes to answer it.)
CLARA: Don't.
DOCTOR: Why not?
CLARA: Because, if you answer it, something will happen.
DOCTOR: What?
CLARA: A thing.
DOCTOR: Huh. It's just a phone, Clara. Nothing happens when you answer the phone.
(He picks up the receiver.)

[Room]

(And the next thing we see is instead of the telephone, he is holding a large worm with a tiny pair of horns by its jaws up against his face. He screams and throws it onto the round table. Clara also screams and throws away a worm.)
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Don't touch it.
CLARA: Where are we? How did we get here?
(A man with computer chips attached to the shaven right side of his head speaks. He is sitting to the left of Clara with his hand on a worm.)
PSI: Who are you? Sorry, what's going on? I don't understand.
(On his left is a dark-skinned woman. Her cheeks briefly bulge in imitation of the worm's horns.)
SAIBRA: Argh! What is that thing?
DOCTOR: It's a memory worm.
CLARA: What happened to your face?
DOCTOR: Deletes your memories.
CLARA: Did you see her face?
SAIBRA: How did I get here?
DOCTOR: The same way we all did, but we've all forgotten.
(There is a metal case in the middle of the table.)
SAIBRA: And who are you?
(The answers are broadcast through a speaker.)
DOCTOR [OC]: I am the Doctor, a Time Lord from Gallifrey. I have agreed to this memory wipe of my own free will.
CLARA [OC]: I am Clara Oswald, human. I have agreed to this memory wipe of my own free will. Do I really have to touch that worm thing?
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, you do. And change your shoes. You're next, Psi.
PSI [OC]: I am Psi- augmented human. I have agreed to this memory wipe of my own free will.
(Psi takes a chip from his head and looks at it. It is marked Memory Compromised.)
SAIBRA [OC]: I am Saibra, mutant human. I have agreed to this memory wipe of my own free will.
(The case unlocks and opens with a golden light. It has two screens so that everyone can watch. An electronically manipulated voice speaks while a golden K in a circle is displayed, then a shadow in a hooded top, presumably the speaker. The voice has a slightly American style accent.)
ARCHITECT [OC]: This is a recorded message. I am the Architect. Your last memory is of receiving a contact from an unknown agency. Me. Everything since has been erased from your minds. Now, pay close attention to this briefing.
(The image now zoomed into a huge building alone one on a planet. It looks like an advertisement for the subject described.)
ARCHITECT [OC]: This is the Bank of Karabraxos, the most secure bank in the galaxy. A fortress for the super-rich. If you can afford your own star system, this is where you keep it. No one sets foot on the planet without protocols. All movement is monitored, all air consumption regulated. DNA is authenticated at every stage. Intruders will be incinerated.
(We see a woman breathe into a tube, but it stays red. Nozzles come out of the walls and burn her and her companion alive. Next shot is of an oriental couple placing a painting into a drawer.)
ARCHITECT [OC]: Each vault, buried deep in the earth, is accessed by a drop-slot at the planet's surface. It's atomically sealed, an unbreakable lock. The atoms have all been scrambled. Your presence on this planet is unauthorised. A team will have been despatched to terminate you.
(Someone hammers on the door and speaks through the grill.)
GUARD [OC]: This is bank security. Open up.
ARCHITECT [OC]: Your survival depends on following my instructions.
GUARD [OC]: Open up and you shall be humanely disposed of.
SAIBRA: There's another exit.
ARCHITECT [OC]: All the information you need is in this case.
(Psi takes a chip from his head and plugs it into the case.)
DOCTOR: What are you doing?
PSI: Downloading.
DOCTOR: Ah. Augmented. Nice.
ARCHITECT [OC]: The Bank of Karabraxos is impregnable.
(The Doctor takes a mobile phone sized item from the case.)
GUARD [OC]: Please stand away from the door. We do not wish to hurt you before incineration.
ARCHITECT [OC]: The Bank of Karabraxos has never been breached. You will rob the Bank of Karabraxos.
(Glass shatters.)

[Office]

(A woman in a very tight suit sits at a white table in a small white room and answers her intercom-on-a-stick.)
DELPHOX: Report.
GUARD [OC]: Sorry, hello? Who is this?
DELPHOX: This is Ms Delphox, Head of Bank Security. I sent you to investigate an off-world intruder.
GUARD [OC]: Did you? I was wondering what we're doing here.

[Room]

GUARD: We found these amazing worms.
(And he is holding one.)

[Teller's room]

(Ms Delphox leaves her desk and goes to the door. She breathes into a tube and it turns green, then opens the door to speak to guards in full armour standing by a misted up glass cage in the room next door.)
DELPHOX: Unwelcome guests. We're going to need the Teller.
(She taps on the glass.)
DELPHOX: Are you hungry, boy?
(And blows the thing inside a kiss.)

[Corridor]

(The four are running, the Doctor is trailing behind and getting out of breath.)
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop. Far enough. Augmented human. Computer augmented, yes? Mainframe in your head?
PSI: I'm a gamer. Sorry, who put you in charge?
DOCTOR: You're a liar. That's a prison code on your neck.
PSI: I'm a hacker slash bank robber.
DOCTOR: Good. This is a good day to be a bank robber. Mutant human. What kind of mutant?
SAIBRA: Like he says, why are you in charge now?
DOCTOR: It's my special power. What's yours?
(Saibra sighs and takes Clara's hand. For a few moments there are two Claras, then she lets go and changes back to her original self.)
SAIBRA: I touch living cells, I can replicate the owner.
CLARA: Your face, when we first saw you...
SAIBRA: I touched the worm.
CLARA: You can replicate their clothes too?
SAIBRA: I wear a hologram shell.
(The Doctor holds out the object he took from the case.)
DOCTOR: Human cells. DNA from a customer, maybe? A disguise to get us in?
CLARA: We're actually going to do it? Rob the bank?
DOCTOR: I don't think we have a choice. We've already agreed to.
(Saibra touches the object.)

[Outside the Bank]

(Now a grey-haired man in a suit is walking with the Doctor, Clara and Psi. This is Mister Porrima, although he is never actually named except on the cast list, so I'll use that here.)
DOCTOR: How long can you maintain the image for?
PORRIMA: For as long as I like.

[Banking hall]

(They enter. Saibra/Porrima leads the way through the massive open space.)
DOCTOR: Question one. Robbing banks is easy if you've got a Tardis. So why am I not using it?
CLARA: Question two, where is the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Okay, that probably should be question one.
(An alarm sounds and security grills block all the exits. The Bank computer has a friendly, slightly cheerful male voice.)
COMPUTER: Banking floor locking down.
PORRIMA: They know we're here.
COMPUTER: Banking floor locking down.
(Ms Delphox enters with two suited heavies and goes to a male customer. Then something with two-toed feet enters, wearing an orange prisoner jump-suit and its arms in a straight jacket. This being has its eyes on the end of flexible stalks, vaguely reminiscent of Gerry Anderson's Creons. It walks slowly with its armoured escort behind, holding onto the ends of its chains. The Teller, I presume.)
PORRIMA: (sotto) What is that?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Hate not knowing.
DELPHOX: Excuse me, sir. I regret to say that your guilt has been detected.
CUSTOMER: What? That, that's totally ridiculous.
DELPHOX: Is it, sir? Well then, we will certainly double-check. The Teller will now scan your thoughts for any criminal intent. Good luck, sir.
(Delphox moves away. The customer puts down his briefcase.)
DOCTOR: Interesting.
PSI: What is?
DOCTOR: The latest thing in sniffer dogs. Telepathic. It hunts guilt.
(A high pitched sound makes the unfortunate customer hold his head in pain.)
CLARA: What about our guilt?
DOCTOR: Currently being drowned out.
CLARA: What's he doing?
DOCTOR: If he has a plan, he's trying not to think of it.
PSI: Ever tried not thinking about something?
CLARA: No.
PORRIMA: You may have to.
(The creature roars.)
DELPHOX: Ah, criminal intent detected. How naughty. What was your plan? Counterfeit currency in your briefcase, perhaps?
CUSTOMER: No, not at all. For God's sake.
DELPHOX: It doesn't really matter, we'll establish the details later. The Teller is never wrong when it comes to guilt. Your account will now be deleted, and obviously your mind. Suppertime.
(The armoured guards hold on to the creature's chains as it steps closer to the customer. It puts its eye stalks together and a pulsating ray is aimed at the customer's head. He clutches his head and Psi feels something, too.)
DOCTOR: It's wiping his mind. Turning his brain into soup.
DELPHOX: Your next of kin will be informed, and incarcerated, as further inducement to honest financial transactions.
(The customer screams.)
CLARA: We've got to help him.
DOCTOR: He's gone already. It's over.
CLARA: He's in agony, look at him.
DOCTOR: Those aren't tears, Clara. That's soup.
(The creature separates its eye stalks. The man stops screaming and a suited heavy catches him. The front of his brain pan is caved in.)
DELPHOX: Account closed. Take him away. He's ready for his close-up.
(She uses a microphone to broadcast.)
DELPHOX: Apologies for the disturbance. Everyone have a lovely day.

(Our four enter a small room with red walls broken up by faux marble columns. There is a computer interface on the wall opposite the ornate metal doors.)
COMPUTER: Deposit booth locking. Please exhale. Your valuables will be transported up from the vault.
(Mister Porrima breaths into the tube. It turns green and Saibra changes back to herself. A case arrives.)
PSI: If he can break in here and plant this thing, then why does he need our help?
DOCTOR: Depends what the thing is.
(He opens the case.)
DOCTOR: Okay, well, I'm no expert, but fuses, timer. I'm going to stick my neck out and say bomb. (to Psi) Bank schematic. Now.
(Psi goes to one of the marble columns and plugs in. A screen appears.)

[Office]

(Ms Delphox is reading the guard's report.)
DELPHOX: So, the man we captured on the banking floor wasn't the target.
GUARD: Four visitors just entered a safety-deposit box.
DELPHOX: The greatest bank in the galaxy. Our reputation must remain secure. The Director will blame us. We'll be fired. Fired with pain.

[Deposit booth]

(Psi has got the schematics on view.)
DOCTOR: The floor below is all service corridors, the veins and arteries of the bank.
(Psi disconnects himself. The Doctor does a brief tap dance in the middle of the floor.)
DOCTOR: He wants us to blow through the floor.
SAIBRA: Well, we'll die if we do that.
DOCTOR: Well, not necessarily. There must be a plan.
CLARA: What if the plan is, we're blowing up the floor for someone else? What if we're not supposed to make it out alive?
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be so pessimistic. It'll affect team morale.
SAIBRA: What, and getting us blown up won't?
DOCTOR: Well, only very, very briefly.
PSI: Er, no. No way. You can do you what you like. I'm going to take my chances out there.
CLARA: Psi.
PSI: No, no, no. This guy, your mate, is a lunatic.
DOCTOR: What do you want, Psi, more than anything else? Whatever it is, it's in this bank. You agreed to rob the most impregnable bank in history. You must have had a very good reason. We all must have. Picture the thing you want most in the universe, and decide how badly you want it. Well?
PSI: Still don't understand why you're in charge.
DOCTOR: Basically, it's the eyebrows.
(The Doctor has primed the device from the case. He puts it in the middle of the floor and it starts to build up power. Everyone grabs a piece of wall and waits. The power peaks, there's a brief flash, then the sound of distand machinery. They turn around and look down a hole in the floor. The Doctor picks up the bomb.)
DOCTOR: Nice. Dimensional shift bomb. Sends the particles to a different plane. Come on then, Team Not Dead.

[Outside the Deposit booth]

GUARD: Open up.
(The team are underneath the booth. The Doctor returns the floor particles to this plane just before the guards stride in and look around, baffled.)

[Basement]

SAIBRA: Well, so, what are we supposed to do now? What's the plan?
DOCTOR: I don't know. The Architect set all this up. It should make sense. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon.
SAIBRA: Ah, so that's it. That's your plan?
DOCTOR: Yep.
SAIBRA: A thing will happen?
DOCTOR: A thing. Probably.
CLARA: Hey, Psi.
(Clara has spotted another case.)
CLARA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: There you go. Thing time.
CLARA: How does he get the cases here?
DOCTOR: By breaking into the bank in advance of breaking into the bank.
CLARA: Well, how did he do that? And if he can do that, why does he need us?
DOCTOR: Not our problem.
PSI: Well, what is our prob-prob-prob-prob-pr?
(Psi sounds like a stuck CD.)
CLARA: You okay?
PSI: Drive glitch. It's fine.
DOCTOR: Guilt is our problem. Guilt, in this bank, is fatal. The Teller can hear it. Ever since that first case was opened, we've been targets. The more we know about why we're here, the louder our guilt screams. That's why we wiped our memories. For our own safety. Now, once I open this, I can't close it again.
PSI: Would it be safer if only one of us learned it?
DOCTOR: I'm waiting for you to volunteer.
PSI: Er, why me?
DOCTOR: Because you didn't need that memory worm, did you? You're half-computer. You can perform a manual delete. You can clear your thoughts.
PSI: Okay.
(Psi carefully opens the case.)
PSI: I don't know what it is. You may as well have a look. Well, what are they?
(Six short tubes with metal ends, and pins that can be pulled out on top.)
DOCTOR: Not a clue.
SAIBRA: Hmm, interesting.
DOCTOR: What is?
SAIBRA: You're lying.
PSI: Er, why would he be lyi-lyi-lyi-lying? Ugh. Sorry. Stress. Drains the batteries.
DOCTOR: Interface with this.
(A wall console.)
SAIBRA: Do we have time for this?
DOCTOR: Well, why not? There's no immediate threat.
(An alarm sounds.)
COMPUTER: Warning. Intruders detected.
DOCTOR: I should stop saying things like that.
COMPUTER: Intruders detected.
DOCTOR: Clara, you stay with Psi. Saibra, let's go and investigate.
COMPUTER: Intru
(Psi jacks himself in to recharge, and blows dirt from a set of contacts on one of his removable chips.)
PSI: Oh. Storm dust.
CLARA: You can delete your memories?
PSI: Yeah, it's not as fun as it sounds.
CLARA: I've got a few I wish I could lose.
PSI: And I lost a few I wish I hadn't. No, I was, I was interrogated in prison. And I guess I panicked. I didn't want to be a risk to the people close to me, so
CLARA: You deleted your friends?
PSI: My friends, anyone who ever helped me, my family.
CLARA: Your family?
PSI: Of course my family.
CLARA: How could you do that?
PSI: Well, I don't know. (sighs) I suppose I must have loved them.

[Corridor]

(The Doctor kicks out a grill underneath a sign that says No Entry Under Any Circumstances, then helps Saibra out.)
DOCTOR: Aren't you going to ask me?
SAIBRA: Why did you lie? Those hardware things, you know what they are.
DOCTOR: Exit strategy of sorts. How did you know I was lying?
SAIBRA: I've had a lot of faces, I find them easy to read.
DOCTOR: Quite a gift.
SAIBRA: Gift?
DOCTOR: It got us in here.
SAIBRA: Mutant gene. No one can touch me. If they do, I transform. Touch me, Doctor, and you'll be looking at yourself. I am alone.
DOCTOR: Why?
SAIBRA: Could you trust someone who looked back at you out of your own eyes?
(They hear a moan, and follow the sound to a row of cells. Psi and Clara run and catch them up.)
CLARA: Oh, my God. Why is he even still alive?
(It is the customer with the caved in skull, being held up by chains manacled around his wrists. His is not the only occupied cell.)
DOCTOR: I don't know. But someone is watching.
(A red light is blinking nearby.)
PSI: Doctor. However this goes, whatever happens, don't let me end up like that.
(An alarm sounds.)
COMPUTER: Intruders on the service level. Intruders on the service level.
(They run to another No Entry etc grill and the Doctor sonicks it.)
DOCTOR: Now this says place to hide.

[Teller's room]

SAIBRA: Where are we?
(The Doctor peers at the Teller in its humid glass case, and it reacts. Can't really tell if the water droplets are inside or outside, sorry.)
DOCTOR: Nobody move. Nobody say a word. It's cocooned. Forced hibernation. Its power is probably dormant.
(There are running boots and voices outside. The Teller moves.)
DOCTOR: Clara. It's locked on to you. It may still be asleep. Don't wake it.
CLARA: Okay. How do I not do that?
DOCTOR: Keep your mind blank. Block everything. Once it locks onto your thoughts, it won't let go.
(The Teller growls gently. Clara closes her eyes.)
DOCTOR: It's waking up. Keep blocking your thoughts, Clara. Don't think.
(The creature roars.)
PSI: This way.
(Saibra sees legs running past another grill as the three return to the one they came through. Somehow she gets trapped, but I can't see how unless the creature somehow mentally grabbed her.)
SAIBRA: Oh.
PSI: Saibra!
CLARA: She's still in there. How do we get her out?
DOCTOR: It's scanning her brain.
PSI: Then what?
DOCTOR: Soup.
CLARA: Then help her.
(Saibra is in pain.)
DOCTOR: Saibra.
SAIBRA: What should I do? How can I get away?
DOCTOR: It's rooting through your brain. It's tasting all the secrets stashed inside. Any moment now, it will finish its sweep and start feasting on what's left.
SAIBRA: And then I become one of those things we saw sitting in a cage?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SAIBRA: Can you not get me out?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I don't know how, once it's locked onto your thoughts.
SAIBRA: Exit strategy. That means what I think it means, right?
(The Doctor holds out one of the tubes to her through the grill.)
DOCTOR: Atomic shredder.
SAIBRA: Painless?
DOCTOR: And instant.
SAIBRA: When you meet the Architect, promise me something. Kill him.
DOCTOR: I hate him, but I can't make that promise.
SAIBRA: A good man. I left it late to meet one of those.
(She uses the shredder, and vanishes in bright blue light. The Teller roars in frustration.)

[Outside the vault]

(They exit through another grill. A big round vault door is at the end of this corridor.)
DOCTOR: Right, vault. That's clear. What's not clear is what we do now.
CLARA: Hey. You okay?
DOCTOR: No, I'm an amnesiac robbing a bank. Why would I be okay?
CLARA: Because Saibra...
DOCTOR: What? Saibra is dead, we are alive. Prioritise if you want to stay that way.
PSI: Oh, is that why you call yourself the Doctor? The professional detachment.
DOCTOR: Listen. When we're done here, by all means, you go and find yourself a shoulder to cry on. You'll probably need that. Till then, what you need is me.
(The Doctor walks away towards the vault.)
CLARA: Underneath it all, he isn't really like that.
PSI: It's very obvious that you've been with him for a while.
CLARA: Why?
PSI: Because you are really good at the excuses.
(The Doctor finds a case in a computer access alcove by the vault door.)
DOCTOR: Another gift from the Architect. Shall we unwrap it?

[Teller's room]

(The escape route has been found.)
DELPHOX: The unbreakable bank. We must locate them. And Director Karabraxos must not know. When people get fired here, it's messy. Release the Teller into the tunnels.

[Outside the vault]

(Psi jacks himself into the small device in the case and downloads its contents. It hurts. He then goes into the computer access alcove while Clara looks at a printed card that was also in the case. TECH 251 ORG 339 PV)
PSI: Right, the system looks like it's time-delayed. There are twenty four lock codes I need to break.
(Growling.)
CLARA: Doctor? It's coming. We're trapped.
DOCTOR: Psi, how long?
PSI: As long as it takes.
DOCTOR: It's locked on to one of our thought trails. We have to split up, minimise the brain signals.
PSI: What happened to your professional detachment, Doctor?
(Psi holds out his hand, and the Doctor gives him one of the shredders.)
CLARA: No, no.
PSI: In case it finds me. It's my choice.
CLARA: You don't use that, okay? Promise me.
PSI: Time to run.
(Psi sits down to work.)

[Corridor]

DOCTOR: Separate.
(Clara and the Doctor go opposite ways through the maze of identical corridors. The Teller moves slowly.)

[Outside the vault]

COMPUTER: Vault locks opening. Vault locks opening. 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17
(As the computer counts down, the red lights around the outside of the circular door turn green. Psi unplugs himself and runs.)

[Corridor]

( Clara tries to hide as the Teller stomps nearer.)
DOCTOR [memory]: Keep your mind clear, Clara. Keep your mind blank.
(She can hear the Teller's heavy breathing nearby, so she tries to make a break for it. But as she runs past the creature, it grabs her with its mind.)
CLARA: Argh.
(The Doctor hears her cry.)
DOCTOR: Clara!
(Psi jacks into a wall.)
PSI [OC]: Come on! Come and find me!
(Psi is uploading or downloading images of criminals from history from the Bank's database, including a Sensorite from the First Doctor stories, Androvax from Sarah Jane Adventures, the Gunslinger, Captain John Hart, Skaldak the Time Warrior, a Slitheen, a Weevil and SJA's Trickster, along with mug shots of humans I don't recognise but someone might. Was one John Dillinger or similar? The Teller releases Clara.)
PSI: Every thief and villain in one big cocktail. I am so guilty! Every famous burglar in history is hiding in this bank right now in one body. Come and feast! Clara? For what it's worth, and it might not be worth much, when your whole life flashes in front of you, you see people you love and people missing you. Well, I see no one.
(Psi stands in front of the Teller and pulls the ring from the top of the shredder with his teeth, like a grenade. The Teller aims its beam at him, and he jabs himself with the shredder, then screams as he disappears. The Teller roars, and Clara runs.)

[Outside the vault]

COMPUTER: Three, two, one. Failed.
(Clara and the Doctor run back to see one red light left.)
COMPUTER: Vault unlocking failed.
(Clara tugs on the bars on the front of the door.)
CLARA: It's not opening. Psi. He died for nothing.
(The Doctor goes to the computer alcove and uses his screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: Multiple locks. Last one still in place.
(He opens up a nearby panel.)
DOCTOR: Atomic seal. Unbreakable, even for me. The Architect would know that. He wouldn't bring us all this way for nothing.
CLARA: And get two people killed.
DOCTOR: Exactly. There must be some logic.
CLARA: Some logic?
DOCTOR: Come on, Architect. What else have you got?
(Thunder outside.)

[Office]

DELPHOX: Report, please. What was the disturbance?

[Banking hall]

GUARD: Solar storm. Getting worse. Interfering with our systems.
(This planet is so close to its sun that there is no time delay between the flare leaving the star and hitting the atmosphere.)

[Outside the vault]

DOCTOR: A storm. The storm's tripping the system. That's what he's got, a storm.
CLARA: How would he know when a storm would hit?
DOCTOR: (laughs) Of course. Stupid, stupid Doctor. Of course, of course.
CLARA: Of course, what?
DOCTOR: Whoever planned all this, they're in the future. This isn't just a bank heist, it's a time travel heist. We've been sent back in time to the exact moment of the storm, to be in exactly the right place when it hits, because that's the only time the bank is vulnerable.
COMPUTER: Vault unlocked.
(The big door swings open.)
DOCTOR: The bank is now open.
COMPUTER: Vault unlocked.
DOCTOR: Come on.

[Vault]

(They step inside the golden vault lined with safety deposit boxes.)< br>DOCTOR: It explains why we're not here in the Tardis.
CLARA: Sorry, what?
DOCTOR: The solar disruption would have made navigation impossible. The one time the bank is vulnerable is the one time we can't just land.
CLARA: Doctor? The code. The code that was in the last case. Look. Tech.
DOCTOR: Technology. 251. Find it.
(They hunt amongst the myriad of racks. Clara finds the right section.)
CLARA: Tech.
(They don't need a key to open the box. The Doctor opens the small case inside. It looks like a fat hypodermic syringe.)
DOCTOR: It's a neophyte circuit. (It lights up blue.) I've only ever seen one once before. It can reboot any system, replace any lost data.
CLARA: Psi. That's what he came for, his reward.
DOCTOR: So what did Saibra come for?
(ORG 339 contains a bottle.)
DOCTOR: Gene suppressant.
CLARA: She wanted to be normal.
DOCTOR: Everyone has a weakness. So the big question is this. What did we come for?
CLARA: PV.
DOCTOR: Private vault. Karabraxos's own fortune?
(The Doctor walks around the rack of boxes and straight into the Teller.)

[Office]

(Two armoured guards stand behind the Doctor and Clara. One has kept his helmet on. The Teller is also there.)
DELPHOX: Intruders are most welcome. They remind us that the bank is impregnable. It's good for morale to have a few of you scattered about the place, preferably on view.
(CCTV images of the brain-dead in the cells are on a section of the wall.)
DELPHOX: Are you ready for your close-up? If you're thinking of ways to escape, the Teller will know before you've even made a move. You'll never be bothered by all that thinking again.
DOCTOR: Useful species.
DELPHOX: Last of its kind, and we've signed an exclusive deal.
DOCTOR: Must be noisy inside its head. Painful to listen to so much chatter, so many secrets. Must drive it wild. How can you force it to obey?
DELPHOX: Oh, everything has a price tag, I think you'll find.
(The storm rages overhead.)
DELPHOX: The storm's getting worse. The customers are leaving. Director Karabraxos will be concerned. Our jobs will be on the line.
DOCTOR: You're scared.
DELPHOX: Oh, I'm terrified. I have the disadvantage of knowing Karabraxos personally.
DOCTOR: If you don't like your boss, why stay?
DELPHOX: My face fits. Now if you'll excuse me, I must take the Teller to its hibernation. You two, dispose of our guests.
(Delphox and the Teller leave, and the door closes behind them. The guards push Clara and the Doctor up against the wall.)
DOCTOR: Don't do this. I'm having a very bad day, and I do not want to be pushed around.
BEARDED GUARD: You're wrong.
DOCTOR: Wrong?
BEARDED GUARD: It's not that bad a day. And you're being very slow.
DOCTOR: Why are you undoing my handcuffs?
(The bearded guard transforms into - )
DOCTOR: Saibra?
(The guard with the helmet on speaks.)
PSI: It looked like death. (he takes it off.) It was actually a teleporter.
(Clara hugs him.)
CLARA: Oh, my God.
PSI: Good, eh? You think we're dead, so the Teller thinks we're dead, and we play the creature at his own mind games.
DOCTOR: No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Sorry, sorry, what? You, you, you're, you're alive?
SAIBRA: Yeah, we're alive. Look at us. We're all alive.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Not dead. Alive.
PSI: There's an escape ship in orbit. Takes you right there. Oh, and there's this big blue box. Is that yours?
DOCTOR: Well, this is good, I suppose. You'll be able to resume the mission. Gene suppressant. Antidote for your condition.
(Saibra takes the bottle from the Doctor.)
DOCTOR: Memory giver. All your yesterdays.
(Psi takes it.)
DOCTOR: There you go. Job done, paid in full. Clever old Architect.
SAIBRA: Very clever.
DOCTOR: I still hate him.
SAIBRA: Me too.
PSI: How were you paid?
DOCTOR: I don't know. There's something in the private vault.

[Basement]

DOCTOR: What's that?
PSI: Supply line. It's the only oxygen down to the private vault. There's another one for water, for basic life support.
CLARA: What, for a private vault?
DOCTOR: Someone likes to hang out with their wealth.

[Private vault]

(We look around the vault whilst listening to the Overture To The Abduction From The Seraglio by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, K384. Lots of small statuary around the place including a Buddha, Tutankamun's golden coffin. The team enter through a grill, of course.)
DOCTOR: Director Karabraxos? Excuse us, but we've come to rob you. So if you want to put your hands above your head, or
(The richly embroidered high backed chair spins round to reveal a woman identical to Ms Delphox with her hands up. The music ends.)
KARABRAXOS: Or? You didn't bring any weapons. That's a bit of an oversight. Security, Karabraxos here.
DOCTOR: You're Karabraxos?
KARABRAXOS: One moment.
DELPHOX [on monitor]: Director Karabraxos, is there a problem?
KARABRAXOS: Intruders in the private vault. Send me the Teller. I want to find out how they got in, and then I want to wipe their memories.
DOCTOR: She's a clone.
KARABRAXOS: It's the only way to control my own security. I have a clone in every facility. Get on it right away.
DELPHOX [on monitor]: Yes, of course.
KARABRAXOS: And then hand in your credentials. You're fired, with immediate effect.
DELPHOX [on monitor]: But please, I've been in your service
KARABRAXOS: Ever since the last one let me down and I was forced to kill it. I can't quite believe that you're putting me through this again.
(Transmission ends.)
KARABRAXOS: My clone. And yet she doesn't even protest. Pale imitation, really. Ha! I should sue.
CLARA: You're killing her? You just said
KARABRAXOS: Fired? I put all of the used clones into the incinerator. Can't have to many of moi scattered around.
PSI: Sorry, you don't get on with your own clone?
DOCTOR: She hates her own clones. She burns her own clones. Frankly, you're a career break for the right therapist. Shut up. Everybody, just, just shut up.
KARABRAXOS: And what is this display now, as amusing as you are?
DOCTOR: Shut up. Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shutetty up up up. What, what did you say? What did you say? What did you say about your own eyes? De-shut up. Say it again.
SAIBRA: How can you trust someone if they look back at you out of your own eyes?
DOCTOR: I know one thing about the Architect. What is it that I know about the Architect? I know one thing. Something that I've known from the very start.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: I hate him. He's overbearing, he's manipulative, he likes to think that he's very clever. I hate him! Clara, don't you see?
(He strikes a handy gong.)
DOCTOR: I hate the Architect.
KARABRAXOS: What in the name of sanity is going on in this room now?
DOCTOR: We're getting sanity judgment from the self-burner. Do you mind if I borrow a little bit of paper?
KARABRAXOS: And what are you doing now?
DOCTOR: I'm giving you my telephone number.
KARABRAXOS: Why?
(He folds the paper over and writes on the outside, too.)
DOCTOR: Well, I thought you might like to call me someday.
(It says, I Am A Time Traveller.)
DOCTOR: Sorry, I thought we were getting along famously. Am I, like, misreading the signals or something?
(The solar storm rattles the building.)
DOCTOR: Oh, that was a big one, wasn't it? I think that your bank is about to close for good, Karabraxos. If I was you, I'd get going. Don't mind us, we'll just stay here and burn.
(The alarm sounds as the solar flare sweeps across the planet and the Bank. The customers panic. Karabraxos is packing a bag. A Fabergé egg?)
DOCTOR: Hard to know what to take. The greatest treasures of the universe in just one suitcase.
(The building shakes again.)
CLARA: Doctor, what's the plan? Is there a plan?
SAIBRA: We can use the shredders and get us back to the ship.
DOCTOR: They're not shredders, they're teleports, and that's not the most interesting thing about them.
SAIBRA: So what is?
DOCTOR: There were six of them. Hey. Give me a call me some time.
COMPUTER: Doors opening.
KARABRAXOS: You'll be dead.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you'll be old. We'll get on famously. You'll be old and full of regret for the things that you can't change.
(Karabraxos gets into her personal lift.)
COMPUTER: Doors closing.
(The Doctor makes a phone me gesture.)
PSI: Doctor, what the hell is going on?
CLARA: Are you remembering?
DOCTOR: No, not a thing. But I'm understanding.
CLARA: What? What is it? What are you understanding?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure yet. I need my memory back. And I think there's only one way to do that.
CLARA: Which would be?
DOCTOR: Soup.
CLARA: Soup?
(Ding! The lift doors open and the Teller enters.)
DOCTOR: Hello, big man. Peckish?
(The Teller grabs the Doctor's mind with its own.)
CLARA: Doctor!
(The pain drives the Doctor to his knees.)
DOCTOR: No, no. Let it take me. Let it read me. It's the only way.
CLARA: It will kill you.
DOCTOR: What have I told you about pessimism? That's it, that's it. There are so many memories in here. Feast on them. Tuck in. Big scarf, bow tie, bit embarrassing. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for minimalism, but I think I came up with magician. In the last few days, there's been a block. Can you see the block? Tell me why I'm here. Show me why I'm here. Show me!

[Clara's flat]

DOCTOR: It's just a phone, Clara. Nothing happens when you answer the phone.

[Bedroom / Clara's flat]

(An old woman lying in a bed is on the other end of the line, hooked up to various monitoring devices.)
KARABRAXOS: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hello?
KARABRAXOS: You gave me this number. My name is Madame Karabraxos. I was once the wealthiest person in the Universe. I need your assistance. I'm dying, with many, many regrets. But one, perhaps, you may be able to help me with.

[Clara's flat]

(The Doctor replaces the receiver.)
DOCTOR: It's a little detour. It's a, it's a job, I've got to do it for someone. Come on.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: We need to rob a bank.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: Clara, I need worms.
(He sets the time rotor going and scrolls through various faces, including Psi, Saibra, and Mister Porrima, with whom he shakes hands then transfers the skin cells to the device in the first case.)
DOCTOR: The Bank of Karabraxos has never been breached.
(Saibra and Psi delete their memories, then Clara strokes the worm.)
DOCTOR: Architect.
(He works to disguise his voice.)
TARDIS AUDIO: Architect.
DOCTOR: Architect.
TARDIS AUDIO: Architect.
DOCTOR: Architect.
TARDIS AUDIO: Architect.
DOCTOR: Architect.
(Then he places the cases where they will be found later / earlier in the show.)
DOCTOR: You will rob the Bank of Karabraxos.
(And reveals himself to be the shadow in the hooded top.)

[Private vault]

(The Teller releases the Doctor.)
DOCTOR: Did you see why we came? Why we're here? We had to delete our own memories, otherwise you'd have known, and then she'd have known, because you were mentally linked. But she's gone now. They've all gone. They have no power over you now. You can do exactly what you want to do now. Exactly what you've always wanted to do.
(A small lock turns on the wall.)
PSI: It knows the combination.
DOCTOR: Of course it does. It was linked to Karabraxos.
CLARA: What exactly are we doing here? That thing killed people.
DOCTOR: Well so might you do, to protect everything you loved.
(The safe door swings open to reveal a second creature in a straight jacket. It wails.)
DOCTOR: There she is. Not the last of its species. The last two.
(Psi works to unchain her.)
DOCTOR: It's okay, it's okay. It's all right.
SAIBRA: Exit strategy. We've got six shredders.
DOCTOR: Exactly. This wasn't a bank heist. It never was. It was rescue mission for a whole species. Flesh and blood, the last currency.
(The lights flicker.)
DOCTOR: Time to go home. What do you think of that, big man?
(A big roar.)

[Planet surface]

DOCTOR: So much mental traffic in the universe. Solitude is the only peace.
(Freed of their clothing and restraints, the two telepathic beings walk off together.)

[Tardis]

(In flight, eating take-out with chopsticks.)
DOCTOR: Gioffre Borgia, mucho scary hombre, says to me, what do you think of our Leaning Tower of Pisa? I say, (leans sideways) it looks okay to me.
(Laughter. Later, saying goodbye.)
PSI: If you ever need help with another bank heist...
(The Doctor shakes Psi's hand, Clara hugs him.)
CLARA: Yeah, it's not really his area.
(The Doctor makes the Phone Me sign. Psi leaves. Later, Saibra hugs the Doctor.)
SAIBRA: See? I don't have your face now.
DOCTOR: Yeah. I kind of miss that.
SAIBRA: Oh, shut up.
(Saibra leave the Tardis. The Doctor rubs his arm where Saibra had squeezed him. And finally -)
DOCTOR: 7.12, local time, as promised. Go and enjoy yourself. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
CLARA: It's a date. You know, I've just realised. I'm going out for another meal now.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. Calories consumed on the Tardis have no lasting effect.
CLARA: What? Are you kidding?.
DOCTOR: Of course I'm kidding. It's a time machine, not a miracle worker. Bye, bye.
CLARA: See you. Don't rob any banks.
DOCTOR: Don't rob any banks what?
CLARA: Without me.
DOCTOR: Course not, boss.
(Clara leaves.)
DOCTOR: Robbing a bank. Robbing a whole bank. Beat that for a date.

[Alien planet]

(With wickedly sharp rocky outcrops sticking sideways out of the desert ground. The Doctor and Clara are chained to ornately carved pillars as twin suns beat down.)
CLARA: There's no way out of this. We're going to die here.
DOCTOR: Pass me the vibro-cutters.
CLARA: They're in my pocket.
DOCTOR: Come on then, pass them to me.
CLARA: In my other jacket. At home.
DOCTOR: Why have you got two jackets? Is one of them faulty?
CLARA: Look, I don't have the vibro-cutters. If I had the vibro-cutters, I wouldn't be able to pass you the vibro-cutters. We're going to starve to death out here.
DOCTOR: Of course we won't starve. The sand piranhas will get us long before that.

[Pub]

(Clara enters and goes to Danny's table.)
CLARA: Hiya. Sorry I'm late.
(They kiss.)
DANNY: You're not. You're brown. You're very brown. You weren't that brown this morning.
CLARA: Sunbed. I'll get 'em in. Usual?

[Clara's flat]

(Clara is about to go out when the Doctor pops his head out of the Tardis.)
DOCTOR: Fish people.
CLARA: What are they like?
DOCTOR: Fish. And people. Come and see.

[Taxi]

CLARA: How's you?
DANNY: Evening. Nice frock. It's a bit wet.
CLARA: Freak shower.
DANNY: Is that seaweed?
CLARA: I said freak.

[Corridor]

(Running as lasers are shot at them.)
CLARA: How much further?
DOCTOR: Tardis has got to be round this corner. I hate soldiers. Don't you hate soldiers?
CLARA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Just keep running!

[Clara's flat]

(She opens the front door to see -)
CLARA: Oh, yeah. Danny. Hiya.
DANNY: Morning. Ready to run?
CLARA: Mmm hmm.

[Clara's bedroom]

(Clara is out of breath and completely drenched in sweat.)
CLARA: I can't keep doing this. I can't do it. Yes, I can, I can do it, of course I can do it. I've got it all under control.

[Tardis]

(Clara enters from her living room.)
CLARA: So, where we off to?
DOCTOR: Clara, you, you look lovely today. Have you had a wash?
CLARA: Why are you being nice?
DOCTOR: Because it works on you. Listen, I'm sorry but there's going to be no trip today. I'm sorry. Er, I've got to do a thing. It might take a while.
CLARA: What thing?
(He keeps the scanner with the flashing red light out of her view.)
DOCTOR: Just a thing.
CLARA: You're being mysterious, and do you know what means?
DOCTOR: I'm a man of mystery.
CLARA: Hmm. It means that you are a very clever man making the mistake, common to very clever people, of assuming that everybody else is stupid. Where are you going?
(She grabs the scanner and he switches it to the view of the galaxy.)
DOCTOR: Undercover. Deep cover.
CLARA: Can you do deep cover?
DOCTOR: What do you mean?
CLARA: Have you seen you?
DOCTOR: Of course I can do deep cover.
CLARA: (giggling) Where, the Magic Circle?
(The Doctor snaps his fingers, and the Tardis doors open.)
DOCTOR: I'll see you when I see you.
(Clara snaps her fingers, and they close again.)
CLARA: When's that?
(Snap, open.)
DOCTOR: When I see you.
CLARA: Hmm. Hmm. I'll be sure to have a wash.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I was meaning to bring it up.
(Clara leaves, shutting the doors then opening them again and pointing meaningfully at her eye before finally leaving. The Doctor calls up the glowing area on the map which is on the scanner - East London.)

[Playground]

(The boys are playing football where they shouldn't as the teachers arrive.)
TEACHER: You lot! Not here. Over there.
COURTNEY: Morning, Mister Pink.
DANNY: Morning, Courtney. And good morning, Miss Oswald.
CLARA: Morning, Mister Pink.
(The group of girls by the entrance giggle.)

[School corridor]

CLARA: Do they know?
DANNY: Possibly. They're children. It's like they've got minds of their own. Are you okay?
CLARA: Yeah, course I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be okay?
DANNY: I dunno. Every time I see you, it's like you're
CLARA: What?
DANNY: In a rush. In a state. In a space helmet, one time.
CLARA: Sorry. Er, I've had a thing and, er, the thing's gone, so I'm all yours.
DANNY: What thing? What's gone?
CLARA: Nothing.
DANNY: It's like you're trying to be mysterious. I'm not stupid, you know.
CLARA: The next few days are all about you. I promise.
(Clara moves in closer, but pupils giggle at the end of the corridor, so she walks away.)

[Staff room]

ARMITAGE: Which means, Jo, you'll have to cover for 8/4M in L3. Hold on, there is just one more thing. Atif's off sick, so we've got a newbie, I did ask him to come along.
(Knocking on the door.)
ARMITAGE: Ah, here he is.
(A tall figure in a brown coverall and holding a broom enters.)
DOCTOR: I'm the new caretaker. John Smith.
DANNY: Welcome to Coal Hill, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR: Thanks. Yes, John Smith's the name. But, you know, here's a thing. Most people just call me the Doctor.
(He winks at Clara.)
DOCTOR: So, if anybody needs me, just, you know, give me a shout. I'll be in the storeroom just getting the lie of the land.
(The staff leave the room.)
DOCTOR: Yes, no body's taking any notice at all. Absolutely good news because it means I must be coming across just as an absolutely boring human being like you.
(Clara mouths What are you doing here? He shuts the door on her.)
DOCTOR: Deep cover. Deep cover.

[School corridor]

DANNY: Do you know him?
CLARA: Know who?
DANNY: The caretaker, Smith. The Doctor.
CLARA: Never seen him before in my life.
DANNY: Bit intense looking. Did you see those eyebrows? Did he wink at you?
CLARA: No, I think that was just a sort of general wink, you know? He winked at everybody. It was a general welcoming wink. Ah, I have, er, left some marking. Assembly. Chop-chop. Off you pop. Catch you in a bit. Excuse me.

[Staff room]

(The Doctor is looking at a plan of the school buildings. He crumples it into his pocket when Clara enters.)
DOCTOR: So, you recognised me, then.
CLARA: You're wearing a different coat.
DOCTOR: But you saw straight through that.
CLARA: Deep cover in my school? Why? Where's Atif, what have you done with him?
(The Doctor wards her off with his broom.)
DOCTOR: He's fine. Hypnotised. He thinks he's got the 'flu. Also a flying car and three wives. It's going to be a rude awakening.
CLARA: Is it aliens? Oh, my God, is that why you're here? Are there aliens?
DOCTOR: It's assembly. You'd better get going. Go and worship something.
CLARA: Are there aliens in this school?
DOCTOR: Listen, it's lovely talking to you, but I've really got to get on. I'm a caretaker now. Look, I've got a brush.
CLARA: Doctor, is there an alien in this school?
DOCTOR: Yes, me. Now, go. The walls need sponging and there's a sinister puddle.
CLARA: You can't do this. You cannot pass yourself off as a real person among actual people.
DOCTOR: I lived among otters once for a month. Well, I sulked. River and I, we had this big fight
CLARA: Human beings are not otters!
DOCTOR: Exactly. It'll be even easier.
CLARA: Okay. One question. And you will answer this question. Are the kids safe?
DOCTOR: No. Nobody is safe. But soon the answer will be yes, everybody is safe, if you let me get on. Now, pretend you don't know me. Stay out of my way. The less you know, the better. I'll explain it all later. Go and sing with the otters.
CLARA: I hate you.
DOCTOR: That's fine. That's a perfectly normal reaction.

[Street]

(Two schoolboys are playing a video game by a large wrought iron gate.)
NOAH: Basically, you've to get that guy on the block and stop that other one shooting him. It's so sick.
YASHE: I, I got that guy. That was, like, six months ago. You actually have to do is flick it that way.
NOAH: Nah, but I'm saying
(A Community Support Officer approaches them.)
MATTHEW: You Coal Hill kids?
NOAH: Yeah? So what if we are?
MATTHEW: Then get to Coal Hill.
YASHE: We've got a free period, mate.
MATTHEW: You want me to take your names?
YASHE: Come on. This is unfair, mate.
(Something rattles on the other side of the gate.)
MATTHEW: Always come in threes. Oi! I know you're in there.

[Old building]

(He goes through the creaky gate and pries a piece of corrugated iron off the main door to the old building.)
MATTHEW: Hello? I'm a police officer. There's no point hiding. Do you hear me? Come on, kiddo.
BLITZER: Five stop intruder. Five stop intruder.
MATTHEW: Turn your game off. It's time for school. Come on. Stop messing about!
(Something with bright blue eyes is watching Matthew with yellow and purple vision. A mechanical device trundles into the light from Matthew's torch.)
BLITZER: Problem solution destroy.
(Matthew screams as the bullets rip through him. We see a smoking severed hand land on the floor. No wonder this story was scheduled for later than usual.)

[English class]

(Clara's bored class are reading Pride and Prejudice out loud.)
KELVIN: Though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not
(The Doctor climbs a ladder to the open window at the back of the classroom. Clara gets up from behind her desk.)
KELVIN: You all right, Miss Oswald?
CLARA: Yes, Kelvin, I'm fine. You carry on.
KELVIN: Every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened 
(They are on the second floor. Clara stands on a chair to talk to the Doctor.)
CLARA: Can I help you, Mister Smith?
DOCTOR: Wrong.
CLARA: I'm sorry?
DOCTOR: On the board. Wrong. Wrong.
(The famous Jane Austen quote 1797 It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.)
CLARA: Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't do this. You are the caretaker, this is not what you do.
DOCTOR: Just taking care.
CLARA: Not your area!
DOCTOR: Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1796.
(Clara clears her throat then addresses the class.)
CLARA: This is Mister Smith, the temporary caretaker, and he's a bit confused.
DOCTOR: Not in 1797, because she didn't have the time. She was so busy doing all
CLARA: Oh, What? I suppose she was your bezzie mate, was she? And you went on holidays together and then you got kidnapped by Boggons from space and then you all formed a band and met Buddy Holly.
DOCTOR: No, I read the book. There's a bio at the back.
(The children giggle.)
CLARA: Get down.
DOCTOR: Boggons?
CLARA: Go.
(The school bell rings.)
CLARA: Right, that's it. Well done, Kelvin. Get going. See you all in a couple of days. Thanks very much.
KELVIN: Miss, what about our homework?
CLARA: Who asks for homework? Amateur.

[School corridor]

(The Doctor is working on a junction cabinet in the courtyard garden and chatting with Danny and another male teacher, who has floppy hair and wears a bow tie. Clara is stopped by a tall schoolboy.)
TOBIAS: Miss Oswald
CLARA: Hello, Tobias, can't really stop.
TOBIAS: I'm in the football team against Durrants on Thursday. Sorry, but can I go early from English Thursday afternoon?
CLARA: Tobias, you can do whatever you want.
(And then the Headmaster.)
ARMITAGE: Ah, Clara, can I grab a quick word?
CLARA: Actually, I, er yes.
ARMITAGE: Two weeks Saturday, the fete, can I put you down for tombola and the raffle? James H can't cover it now. His wife's going into hospital. Hip replacement. Constant agony. CLARA: Great. No, awful. That's terrible. Awful. I hope she'll be okay. Er, I'll do anything. Anything. Okay, bye.

[Courtyard]

COURTNEY: Miss Oswald, Katie Sharps says I pulled her hair in Biology.
CLARA: Courtney, you are big enough to look after yourself. Next class, jog on, I need to talk to Mister Pink.
COURTNEY: Ozzie loves the Squaddie.
CLARA: What was that?
COURTNEY: Nothing.
ADRIAN: Of course, Danny Pink here is your man, Mister Smith. Five years' military experience, sergeant, here and Afghan, so electrics, boilers, if you need a hand, give him a shout.
(Clara takes a watering can from a girl and uses it as an excuse to overhear the conversation.)
DANNY: I, I've helped Atif with a couple of things.
DOCTOR: I'm sure I won't need you, Sergeant. Fully qualified. (sparks) You best get back to your PE class.
DANNY: Oh, I teach maths.
DOCTOR: Do you? What, in emergencies?
DANNY: No. I'm a maths teacher.
ADRIAN: Yeah, he's a maths teacher
(Glass breaks.)
ADRIAN: Mohammed, put that down!
(He leaves.)
DOCTOR: How does that work? What if the kids have questions?
DANNY: About what?
DOCTOR: Maths.
DANNY: I answer them. I'm a maths teacher.
DOCTOR: But he said you were a soldier.
DANNY: Yeah. I was a soldier, now I'm a maths teacher.
DOCTOR: But what about all the PE?
DANNY: I don't teach PE. I'm not a PE teacher.
DOCTOR: Sorry, that seems very unlikely.
CLARA: Er, excuse me. Mister Pink, I think class 9M4 are waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, you better run along, Sergeant. That ball isn't going to kick itself, is it?
DANNY: I, I'm not a PE teacher, I'm a maths teacher.
DOCTOR: Nope, sorry. No, I can't retain that. I've tried. It's just not going in.
(Danny leaves.)
CLARA: So, Pink? The name remind you of anything?
DOCTOR: Yeah. The colour.
CLARA: Colonel Orson Pink? The guy we met at the end of the universe.
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah. Same name, doesn't look anything like him though.
CLARA: Looks very like him.
DOCTOR: Does he? I don't know. Who remembers a PE teacher?
(The Doctor places a gizmo with three green lights in the the cabinet he was working in, then locks it up.)
CLARA: Oh, never mind. What are you doing? What, what's in there?
DOCTOR: So, is he here then?
CLARA: Is who here?
DOCTOR: The one that you keep going on serious dates with.
CLARA: If he is, are you going to start talking like a normal human being?
DOCTOR: I promise I won't. I'm being nice.
CLARA: Doctor
ADRIAN: Clara. Got this period free, yes?
CLARA: No. Yes.
ADRIAN: Great. Shakespeare.
CLARA: Sorry, what, Adrian?
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.
CLARA: You see what?
DOCTOR: Nothing. Nothing at all.
ADRIAN: Excuse me. We have to talk about The Tempest.

[School corridor]

ADRIAN: In light of the changes to the sixth form Shakespeare module, blah-de-blah.
CLARA: Yes, sorry, of course.
(They turn and look at the Doctor, who is following them.)
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, no, of course, of course, yes. Don't mind this old man. You two kids just pop off together.
CLARA: Why are you talking like an idiot?
DOCTOR: I'm a caretaker. Don't mind me.
ADRIAN: What we have to get across, I feel, is that fascinating enigma of its not-finishedness.
CLARA: Mmm, yes, good point, Ade.
DOCTOR: (sotto) Oh, Clara.
(The Doctor carries on taking care around the school, putting his green light gizmos on the lights in the corridors. He sees a piece of graffiti on a window - Ozzie loves the Squaddie.)
DOCTOR: What does that mean? Kids. What's the matter with kids today?
(He wipes it off.)

[Playground]

(Another gizmo goes inside a drain grating. Part of the playground has a large chessboard painted on it, with corresponding sized pieces.)
BOY [OC]: Shoot! Yes!
(A black rook is knocked over by a football.)
CLARA: Hey, I said you could play chess, I did not say you could play football on the chessboard. Jack, Morgan, come on, help me out, clear it up.
(The Doctor whistles We Don't Need No Education, from Pink Floyd's The Wall.)

[Outside the Caretaker's storeroom]

DOCTOR: And one for luck.
(A gizmo goes into the hanging basket by the door.)

[Caretaker's storeroom]

(Where the Tardis is parked.)
DOCTOR: Okay. Now we're in business. Let's see the lie of the land. Time to see what's going on.
(He goes into the Tardis, and a green light floods out of it. Courtney enters the storeroom.)
COURTNEY: Hello? Oi. What are you doing? Are you in there?
DOCTOR [OC]: Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most dangerous of them all?
(The green light goes out.)
COURTNEY: There's been a spillage in Geography, I need some paper towels.
(Doctor comes out of the Tardis.)
DOCTOR: Can't you read?
COURTNEY: Course I can read. Read what?
DOCTOR: The door. It says, Keep Out.
COURTNEY: No, it says, Go Away Humans.
DOCTOR: Oh, so it does. Never lose your temper in the middle of a door sign.
COURTNEY: What was you doing in there? What's that box?
DOCTOR: The caretaker's box. Every caretaker has their own box.
COURTNEY: It says Police.
DOCTOR: Exactly, there's a policeman in there, in case of emergencies and children. Towels, there, g-g-go.
COURTNEY: What was that green glow? There was a green glow coming from in there. What was it?
DOCTOR: Of course there was. What's a policeman without a death ray?
(School bell.)
DOCTOR: Oh, listen, there's the bell. Off you go. Haven't you got shoplifting to go to?
COURTNEY: I'm going to tell the Headmaster.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, fine. Well, cut along, you're running out of time.
COURTNEY: For what?
DOCTOR: Everything. Human beings have incredibly short life spans. Frankly, you should all be in a permanent state of panic. Tick tock, tick tock.
COURTNEY: You're weird.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. What about you?
COURTNEY: I'm a disruptive influence.
DOCTOR: Good to meet you.
COURTNEY: And you.
(They shake hands.)
DOCTOR: Now get lost.
COURTNEY: Okay.
(Courtney leaves as Clara enters.)
COURTNEY: Hello, miss. Love to the Squaddie.
CLARA: Sorry, what did you say? What was she doing in here?
DOCTOR: Paper towels. Now, I imagine you have many questions. Fire away. I won't answer any of them.
CLARA: What were they like?
DOCTOR: What were who like?
CLARA: The others before me. Did they let you get away with this kind of thing? This school is in danger.
DOCTOR: Well, it's lucky I'm here, then.
CLARA: From you.
DOCTOR: Me?
CLARA: You wouldn't be here if there wasn't an alien threat nearby. Your strategy for dealing with it involves endangering this school.
DOCTOR: You don't know that.
CLARA: I don't know anything because you haven't told me anything, which means I wouldn't approve, which means you are endangering this school.
(The Doctor activates his sonic screwdriver and reveals a green glowing globe.)
CLARA: What's that?
DOCTOR: It's a scanner. I'm scanning. Why do I keep you around?
CLARA: Because the alternative would be developing a conscience of your own. Scanning for what?
DOCTOR: Any alien technology in this vicinity should show up. I used to have a teacher exactly like you once.
CLARA: You still do. Pay attention.
(The scanner displays a four legged machine which looks a wheelchair with an alien sitting in it. If you have seen Falling Skies, think skitter.)
CLARA: What the hell is it?
DOCTOR: A Skovox Blitzer. One of the deadliest killing machines ever created. Probably homed in here because of artron emissions. You've had enough of them in this area over the years. There's enough explosive in its armoury to take out the whole planet.
(For those who don't know, time travellers absorb artron energy as they go through the Time Vortex, and it might be a Tardis power source - see Four to Doomsday. The Doctor's granddaughter went to Coal Hill school, and his first companions were teachers there.)
CLARA: Then leave it alone.
DOCTOR: Sooner or later it will creep from its hidey-hole and some military idiot will try to attack it.
(He turns off the image.)
DOCTOR: The world is full of PE teachers.

[Tardis]

CLARA: So, your insanely dangerous plan is?
(The Doctor holds up a digital wrist watch with an expanding metal bracelet.)
CLARA: A new watch. Tiny bit disappointed.
DOCTOR: This is a very special watch.
(The Doctor puts it on, presses a button and vanishes.)
CLARA: Doctor? Oi! Ow! Did you just flick my nose? You're invisible. Ha, ha! Oh, my God, that's incredible.
DOCTOR [OC]: Correct. I am invisible and I am incredible. It's simply a matter of reversing light waves. Hang on, I'm coming back.
CLARA: All right, where are you?
(The Doctor reappears.)
DOCTOR: So, I give the Blitzer a tiny whiff of non-threatening alien tech, I lead it back here, but I don't want it to scan me, hence invisible.
CLARA: So you're, you're leading the thing here? To a school? My, my school?
DOCTOR: My school? Oh, that is telling. This is the only suitably empty place in the area. I've set up a circle of time mines around the school. Chronodyne generators. Bit unstable.
(He throws one of his little gizmos to Clara.)
DOCTOR: I switch them on, the Blitzer gets sucked into a big old time vortex, billions of years into the future. It's dead easy. Tiny bit boring. I'll need a book and a sandwich.
CLARA: And me. You're not doing this alone.
(She gives him the gizmo back.)
DOCTOR: I don't need you this time. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll go somewhere nice. Ancient Egypt. Crocodilopolis. They worship a big crocodile there, so the name is a useful coincidence. Go and canoodle with your boyfriend. Come on. I wasn't born yesterday. Far from it.
CLARA: You did recognise him.  
DOCTOR: Possibly reminded me of a certain dashing young time traveller.
CLARA: Oh, of course you recognised him. I. Sorry. Stupid. I, I underestimated you.
DOCTOR: It's easily done. There's a lot to estimate.
CLARA: And you, you like him?
DOCTOR: Yes, I like him very, very much. Go home and canoodle. Doctor's orders. Come on.
CLARA: Just this once, I'm doing what I'm told.
DOCTOR: Oh, sing hosanna.
CLARA: Ah. So easy.

[Playground]

DANNY: Miss Oswald.
CLARA: Ah, Mister, Mister Pink.
DANNY: Are you still on for tonight? Cos you had your I'm about to cancel frown on.
CLARA: There's a specific frown?
DANNY: And I was going to say, it's okay, I might have a thing, so .
CLARA: A thing?
DANNY: Er, tomorrow instead?
CLARA: Tomorrow's parents' evening.
DANNY: Not all evening.
CLARA: No. Not all evening.
(The Doctor comes out of his storeroom.)
DANNY: What do you think of him?
CLARA: Er, who? The caretaker?
DANNY: Where did he come from? What was he before? He doesn't seem like a caretaker.
CLARA: Well, he speaks very highly of you.
DANNY: Anyway. Good night, Miss Oswald.
CLARA: Good night, Mister Pink.

[School]

(Night. The Doctor comes out of the main doors and turns on his screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: And we're off.
(As the Doctor goes in search of the Blitzer, Danny finds a little gizmo blinking green underneath a fire alarm, and pulls it off. Its lights turn red.)

[Old building]

DOCTOR: Home, sweet home.

[Caretaker's storeroom]

CLARA: Canoodling cancelled, if you need a hand. Doctor? You invisible? I am so going to confiscate that watch.

[Old building]

(The Doctor is invisible now.)
DOCTOR [OC]: Where are you, my sleeping beauty?
(The Blitzer activates. It cannot see its target.)
DOCTOR [OC]: Gotcha. Let's dance!

[Outside the Caretaker's storeroom]

CLARA: Doctor? Where are you?
(She walks away, Danny arrives and knocks on the storeroom door.)
DANNY: Hello?
(He spots another gizmo, this time blinking red, in the hanging basket, and takes it.)

[Alleyway]

(The Skovox Blitzer is following the invisible Doctor's infrared footprints.)
BLITZER: Nine stop query rescan. Target reacquired success success.

[School]

DOCTOR [OC]: Come on, come on, come on.
(The doors burst open.)
DOCTOR [OC]: Gangway! Not far now. Come on.
BLITZER: Nine stop parsing data pursue.
DOCTOR [OC]: Bingo.
BLITZER: Target reacquired.
(It trundles off as Danny enters.)
DANNY: Hello?

[School hall]

(The Doctor turns off the invisibility watch and sees that the gizmos on the circle of chairs are not flashing green.)
DOCTOR: What? Red? Red. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
(The Blitzer enters.)
BLITZER: Range one point four nine scan complete problem problem.
DOCTOR: Listen. I'm unarmed. I'm peaceful. Don't you understand? I, I know that you shouldn't be on this planet but I can help you with that. I
BLITZER: Problem solution destroy.
DANNY: I want a word with you.
DOCTOR: Get back!
(The Blitzer turns on Danny.)
BLITZER: Problem solution destroy.
(The Blitzer starts shooting, Danny ducks and throws himself to the floor. dropping the chronodyne gizmo. It slides into the circle of chairs and turns green. Then he picks up a chair to attack the Blitzer.)
DANNY: No! Get away from me!
(The Doctor uses his screwdriver. The chair is sucked into a vortex that he creates. The Blitzer is also sucked towards it, as is Danny.)
BLITZER: Temporal disrupt. Warning warning. Temporal failure.
(Clara enters and runs to grab Danny.)
CLARA: No! No, no, no, no! Doctor, stop! Doctor!
BLITZER: Warning system failure. Abort. Abort.
(The Blitzer goes into the golden vortex, and the Doctor turns it off. Then he spots the gizmo that Danny dropped and picks it up.)
DOCTOR: (sarcastic) Oh, oh, well done, PE, brilliant work. What's this? A chronodyne generator? I'll just deactivate that, shall I? I've got a swimming certificate so that qualifies me to meddle with higher technology. Never mind that some people are actually trying to save the planet. Oh, no. There's only room in my head for cross-country and the offside rule.
CLARA: Danny, what are you doing here?
DANNY: I was checking up on him. He's been up to something, fiddling with the electric, but what the? No. What? Did you see that thing? Tell me you saw that thing.
CLARA: I saw the thing, yeah. Doctor, are we safe? Is the planet safe? It's gone?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, for the moment. But the thing is, you see, the chronodyne generators have to be precisely aligned to generate the vortex. But the sergeant here, he went and moved one.
CLARA: But the chronodyne worked. It's gone.
(The Doctor measures with his screwdriver while Danny looks at a burning hole in the middle of a load of stacked chairs in the far corner.)
DOCTOR: But not far enough. The vortex will open here again, but not in a billion years.
CLARA: Then when?
DOCTOR: Er, seventy four hours. Three days? Three days to think of something new because now it knows what to expect. Now it has scanned me and it will kill me on sight, thanks to PE here.
DANNY: Clara, why are you talking to him like that? Why are you using words like chronodyne? Was that thing a space thing? Oh. Oh, my God, you're from space. You're a spacewoman. You said you were from Blackpool.
(The Doctor is writing in a notebook.) 
CLARA: It's a play! For the summer fete.
DOCTOR: It's a what?
CLARA: Yes, it's a play. Shut up, it is a play. We are rehearsing a play. Shh, shh, shh, shh. A surprise play. And, er, you see, the vortex thing is, is a lighting effect. Very clever. And that thing is, is one of the kids. In fancy dress. Really, really good fancy dress.
DANNY: How stupid do you think I am?
DOCTOR: I'm willing to put a number on it.
DANNY: I'm not a moron, Clara. And he's not the caretaker. He's your dad. Your space dad.
DOCTOR: Oh, genius. That is, that is really, really brilliant reasoning. How can you think that I'm her dad when we both look exactly the same age?
CLARA: We do not look the same age.
DOCTOR: I was being kind. Right, I'm going to hypnotise him. I'm going to erase his memory.  
CLARA: Doctor, stop!
DOCTOR: Tiny little brain, only take a moment.
CLARA: He's my boyfriend.
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try not to erase the whole thing. I'll leave the bits that.
CLARA: He's my boyfriend. I thought you'd figured this out.
DOCTOR: Him?
CLARA: Yes, him.
DOCTOR: No, he's not.
CLARA: Yes, he is.
DANNY: Yes, I am.
DOCTOR: But he's a PE teacher. You wouldn't go out with a PE teacher. It's a mistake. You've made a boyfriend error.
DANNY: I am not a PE teacher. I am a maths teacher.
DOCTOR: You're a soldier. Why would you go out with a soldier? Why not get a dog or a big plant?
CLARA: Because I love him!
DOCTOR: Why would you say that? Is this part of the surprise play?
CLARA: (sigh) There is no surprise play.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a roller coaster with you tonight, isn't it? What about the handsome one, the one with the bow tie?
CLARA: Who? Adrian? No, no, no. He's just a friend and not my type.
DANNY: Clara, are you going to explain any of this? Who is this guy?
CLARA: The Doctor is
DOCTOR: Go on.
DANNY: Yes, explain. Who is he? Why have you never mentioned him?
CLARA: Because he's an alien.
DANNY: Er, are you an alien?
CLARA: No, no, no, I'm still from Blackpool. Me and the Doctor, we travel through time and space.
DOCTOR: Exhibit A.
(The Doctor pulls the curtains back on the stage.)
CLARA: It's called a Tardis, but it's disguised as an old police phone box.
(She gets on stage and the Doctor feeds her the next line.)
DOCTOR: (sotto) It's bigger on the inside.
CLARA: And it's bigger on the inside than the outside.
(The Doctor opens the Tardis doors.)
DOCTOR: Voila.
CLARA: And we travel the universe in it.
(Danny leans in and looks around, then at the outside, and the inside again.)
DANNY: And what about that thing? Did you bring that here?
DOCTOR: No. I'm going to protect you from that thing.
DANNY: You said it was coming back.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is coming back, thanks to you.
DANNY: This is a school. We have to evacuate, call the Army.
DOCTOR: And that is the most dangerous thing right there.
(The Doctor closes the Tardis doors.)
DOCTOR: Are you sure hypnotising's not on the menu?
CLARA: Yes.
DANNY: But we need to get help. This is an emergency.
DOCTOR: Look, take him away. Shut him up, shut him down. Up or down, it doesn't matter to me. I've got a lot of work to do. Again.
CLARA: Will you be okay?
DOCTOR: Why wouldn't I be okay? I was fine till you two blundered in.
DANNY: Am I just being ignored?
(Clara has to help the bewildered Danny down the stairs from the stage.)
CLARA: Come on, Danny. It's all right, it's. Come on, it's all fine. You'll be okay. Let's er, get those legs moving. That's it, down those stairs. Yep, that's it. This can all be explained and everything will be fine.
DOCTOR: And when this is all over, you can finish the job.
CLARA: How do you mean?
DOCTOR: Well, you've explained me to him. You haven't explained him to me.

[Danny's flat]

CLARA: What do you think? Say something.
DANNY: So, there's an alien, that used to look like Adrian. Then he turned into a Scottish caretaker and every now and then, when I'm not looking, you elope with him.
CLARA: I don't elope.
DANNY: Do you love him?
CLARA: No.
DANNY: Really had enough of the lies.
CLARA: Not in that way.
DANNY: What other way is there?
CLARA: You know what I mean.
DANNY: I don't know what you mean. I know what you tell me, which isn't always the truth.
CLARA: Danny
DANNY: Why do you do it? Why do you fly off in the box with him? The truth. Please, just this once.
CLARA: Because it's amazing. Because I see wonders.
DANNY: Okay.
CLARA: What are you thinking?
DANNY: That's a good question. It's funny, you only really know what someone thinks of you when you know what lies they've told you. I mean, you say you've seen wonders, you've seen amazing things, and you kept them secret from me. So what do you think of me, Clara?
CLARA: Please, tell me how I fix this.
DANNY: I just want to know who you are.
CLARA: You know who I am.
DANNY: When you're with him. When you're with the Doctor.

[Outside the Caretaker's storeroom]

(Clara comes out with the invisibility watch.)
CLARA: (sotto) Okay, I think we've just got time before parents' evening.
DANNY: An invisibility watch? Not even a ring.
(Danny puts it on.)
CLARA: Press the button on the side, you're invisible. You'll see me with the Doctor, the other me. The exactly the same other me. Okay?

[Tardis]

(The Doctor is building a contraption.)
DOCTOR: Afternoon. Thanks for keeping out of my way. You haven't brought Dave with you, I hope.
CLARA: His name's Danny. And no, I haven't. I've er, I explained it all to him. He gets it. He took it really well.
DOCTOR: Pass me that synestic.
CLARA: So, when the Blitzer comes back, are you going to catch him with that?
DOCTOR: It'll be a long, fiddly job. It's going to take me at least twenty four hours. Even longer if people keep talking to me, so do keep going.
CLARA: If it comes back Thursday night, are you sure about that? Cos you said the chronodyne is unstable.
DOCTOR: If you want bother someone, go and bother PE.
CLARA: He's a maths teacher.
DOCTOR: That's a shame, I like maths.
CLARA: Not a soldier.
DOCTOR: Interesting.
CLARA: What is?
DOCTOR: I'm bored. Let's go somewhere fun. What do you say? Do you want to see the Thames frozen over? Oh, those frost fairs.
(The Doctor goes around the console, setting controls. Clara follows, returning them to neutral.)
CLARA: But you can't. The Skovox thing.
DOCTOR: It's a time machine. We can get back straightaway, like we always do on your dates. Just make sure you don't get yourself a tan or anything, or lose a limb.
CLARA: I don't think we should, not this time.
DOCTOR: You've never said no before. Not even in the middle of dinner. Remember when you had to eat two meals in a row?
CLARA: I just think, with the school in danger
(Danny turns off the watch.)
CLARA: Danny, why are you?
DANNY: He already knows I'm here. That's why he's talking like that. He's being clever.
DOCTOR: Now you mention it, being a Time Lord, I can feel a light shield aura when it's right next to me.
DANNY: Oh ho, ho. Time Lord? Might have known.
DOCTOR: Might have known what?
DANNY: Well, the accent's good, but you can always spot the aristocracy. It's in the, the attitude.
CLARA: Danny.
DANNY: Now, Time Lords, do you salute those?
DOCTOR: Definitely not.
DANNY: Ah. Sir!
(Danny salutes.)
DOCTOR: And you do not call me sir.
DANNY: As you wish, sir. Absolutely, sir.
DOCTOR: And you can get out of my Tardis!
DANNY: Immediately, sir.
CLARA: Doctor, this is stupid, this is unfair.
DANNY: One thing, Clara. I'm a soldier, guilty as charged. You see him? He's an officer.
DOCTOR: I am not an officer!
DANNY: I'm the one who carries you out of the fire. He's the one who lights it.
DOCTOR: Out. Now.
DANNY: Right away, sir. Straight now?
DOCTOR: Yes.
DANNY: Am I dismissed?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are!
DANNY: That's him. Look at him, right now. That's who he is.
(Danny leaves.)
DOCTOR: On balance, I think that went quite well.

[Caretaker's storeroom]

CLARA: Danny, it's not time to go home yet. It's parents' evening.
(Clara leaves.)
DOCTOR: Humans. I never learn.
COURTNEY: What's in the box? It's not really a policeman, is it?
DOCTOR: You want to know what's in that box? I'll tell you what's in that box. It's a time machine. It also travels in space. And it usually contains a man who just wants to get on with his work of preventing the end of the world, but keeps being interrupted by boring little humans.
COURTNEY: Cool. So, that's really a spaceship?
(The Doctor pulls Courtney back from the Tardis by her collar.)
DOCTOR: I'm serious. I'm trying to save this planet.
COURTNEY: End of the world for me tonight, whatever you do. Parents' evening.
DOCTOR: Is your name really Disruptive Influence?
COURTNEY: Courtney Woods. Can I go in space?
DOCTOR: I'll let you know. I may have a vacancy. But not right now.
(He hustles Courtney out.)
DOCTOR: Two days. I can do it.

[Gymnasium]

(The teachers are laying out their tables.)
ARMITAGE: Right, are we quorate? Time to admit the hordes. And look who's at the front of the queue.
ADRIAN: Who are they?
CLARA: Courtney Woods' mum and dad.
ADRIAN: Can someone else do them first?
DANNY: No problem, Ade. I can cope with anything tonight.
ARMITAGE: Oh, happy days.
(He opens the doors and lets the parents in. Meanwhile, in the School Theatre, a golden vortex appears and a chair is thrown out.)

[Tardis]

(The Doctor carrying his tool box when the scanner beeps.)
DOCTOR: No, no, no. No! No, no, no, no, no!
(He grabs his ghostbusters backpack and runs out.)

[Gymnasium]

DANNY: I would say yes, I'm afraid Courtney is a disruptive influence.
MR WOODS: Yeah, but last year you said she was a very disruptive influence.
MRS WOODS: So, I suppose that counts as an improvement.
(Danny spots the Doctor at the doors, and does a loud Ahem! Clara looks up and sees the Doctor gesturing to them.)
DANNY: Excuse me, I think the caretaker wants me.
CLARA: Sorry, Mrs Christodolou, I think er, I think the caretaker wants me too.
MRS CHRISTOPHOLOU: But what about my Angelina?
CLARA: Yeah, she's great, yeah, a really great girl,  A plus, ten out of ten, top of the class. Sorry. Although, actually, handwriting could be better.
(Danny and Clara run out.)
ARMITAGE: I'm sure they'll be back in a moment.
MRS WOODS: Looks like our Courtney was right about those two.

[Playground]

CLARA: What's happening?
DOCTOR: Clara, the vortex is opening.
DANNY: You said Thursday night. Right, hall, quick.
DOCTOR: PE, shut up. Clara, it'll scan the area. If it gets to parents' evening, it'll kill them all.
DANNY: We've got to evacuate.
DOCTOR: Shut up!
CLARA: Quickly. What do I do?
DOCTOR: It'll be here any second. Get to the hall.
(He gives her the sonic screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: Give it some squirts of helicon energy, setting number forty one. No more than three seconds each, random pulses. Distract it, then you lead it away from the hall, give me two minutes.
CLARA: Then what?
DOCTOR: Just run straight to the Tardis.
DANNY: But your gadget isn't ready yet. Twenty four hours, you said.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I've revised that down to two minutes. Probably. Clara, go.
CLARA: On my way.
DANNY: You're using her like a decoy?
DOCTOR: No, not like a decoy. As a decoy. Don't they teach you anything at stupid school?
DANNY: Well, is there anything I can do?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, and this is very, very important. Leave us alone!

[School hall]

(Clara looks into see the Blitzer in the vortex.)
BLITZER: Disrupt temporal lock. Disengaged scan.
CLARA: Here we go.
(She waves the sonic screwdriver.)
BLITZER: Incoming stop identified Helicon Helicon commence retargeting.
(It chases Clara.)

[Corridor]

(Danny sees Clara run past the top of the corridor.)
BLITZER [OC]: Target acquired. Destroy.
(Then it trundles past.)

[Playground]

(Clara squirts more Helicon.)
BLITZER: Target within range.
(She runs into the Caretaker's storeroom)
BLITZER: Problem solution destroy.
(It destroys the door.)

[Caretaker's storeroom]

BLITZER: Destroy. Destroy.
CLARA: Doctor, now! It's got to be now!
DOCTOR: Twenty seconds.
BLITZER: Destroy. Destroy.
CLARA: Doctor!
(Clara dodges the weapons fire and helps the Doctor on with the backpack.)
DOCTOR: Am I green? Am I green?
CLARA: You're green!
(The Doctor uses a commentator's microphone to talk to the Blitzer via the backpack. You know, the ones with the bar that the speaker rests against their upper lip to keep it at the correct distance whilst close enough not to pick up surrounding sound.)
DOCTOR: Stop! Skovox Blitzer!
BLITZER: Awaiting orders.
DOCTOR: Superior Skovox Artificer. Analyse stop analyse stop.
BLITZER: Superior recognised. Pattern one one oh, Orders orders.
CLARA: Why's it listening to you?
DOCTOR: Listening to its superior. This is a rough copy. It thinks I'm its general. Initiate input. Commence shutdown protocol. No conflict. Conclusion?
BLITZER: Problem solution.
DOCTOR: Conclusion.  
BLITZER: Final input code missing. Emergency terminate. Initiate self-destruct in nine eight
(The Blitzer's eyes turn from blue to red.)
DOCTOR: The input code. I forgot the final input code.
(He stabs frantically at a keypad.)
BLITZER: Seven six five
CLARA: Do it now!
DOCTOR: I need time. Distract it, Clara!
CLARA: Me? What can I do?
BLITZER: Three two one.
DANNY [OC]: Oi, Skovox. Over here.
(Danny turns off the invisibility watch, then runs and somersaults over the Blitzer.)
BLITZER: Under attack.
DOCTOR: Artificer Artificer. Stop. Confirm stop override final input code.
BLITZER: Code accepted. Abort self-destruct. Orders accepted  Stop stop stop.
(The Blitzer powers off. Clara hugs Danny.)
CLARA: Oh, my God! Oh, my God, you were amazing! Oh, my God, you were so brilliant.
DANNY: Well, yeah, I was okay, wasn't I? I was behind you every step of the way. Had to make sure you were safe. (to the Doctor) You okay?
DOCTOR: Okay.
CLARA: Just okay?
DANNY: It's all right, it doesn't matter. I don't need him to like me. It doesn't matter if he likes me or hates me, I just need to do exactly one thing for you. Doctor, am I right?
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: What? What one thing?
DANNY: I need to be good enough for you. That's why he's angry. Just in case I'm not.
CLARA: He, er, he did just save the whole world.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. Good start.

[Space]

(The Blitzer is cast adrift from the Tardis, micro-meteorites bouncing off its metal surface.)
DOCTOR [OC]: Farewell, Skovox Blitzer. Have a nice war. So, Courtney Woods, impressed yet?

[Tardis]

(The doors are open, and Courtney is holding on to the doorframe for dear life.)
COURTNEY: Actually, I'm feeling a bit ill.
DOCTOR: Ah, it can be a bit overwhelming. But look. The Olveron Cluster. A million stars, a hundred million inhabited planets.
(Courtney gags and runs inside. Sounds of an unfortunate occurrence.)
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. There has been a spillage.

[Danny's flat]

(Snuggling on the sofa in front of the television.)
CLARA: So, what do you think of him now? 
DANNY: Of the Doctor?
CLARA: Yeah. See, he's all right, isn't he, really, underneath it all.
(She turns the television off with the remote.)
CLARA: Okay. Tell me what you're thinking.
DANNY: I know men like him. I've served under them. They push you and make you stronger, till you're doing things you never thought you could. I saw you tonight. You did exactly what he told you. You weren't even scared. And you should have been.
CLARA: I trust him. He's never let me down.
DANNY: Fine. If he ever pushes you too far, I want you to tell me, because I know what that's like. You'll tell me if that happens, yeah?
CLARA: Yeah, it's a deal.
DANNY: No. It's a promise.
CLARA: Okay. I promise.
DANNY: And if you break that promise, Clara, we're finished.
CLARA: Don't say that.
DANNY: I'm saying it because if you don't tell me the truth, I can't help you. And I could never stand not being able to help you. We clear?
CLARA: Yes. We're clear.
(They snuggle down again and she turns the television back on.)

[White corridor]

(The late CSO is sitting across a desk from a man in a pale grey suit.)
MATTHEW: It was mad. It was like in a film or on the telly like, with science fiction guns.
SEB: Skovox Blitzer, sounds like. We've had a few in from that. Wouldn't feel too bad.
MATTHEW: If I hadn't. If I hadn't. Hang on. That doesn't make sense.
SEB: Makes perfect sense to me. 
MATTHEW: How did I escape? I, I don't remember how I got away.
SEB: Well, I was coming to that. I'm afraid you really rather didn't.
(Matthew stands up and looks around.)
MATTHEW: Then how did I get here?
SEB: Well. Big question.
MATTHEW: Where am I?
SEB: What name would you like? There's a range. The afterlife. The Promised Land. I'm partial to the Nethersphere.
(Matthew goes to the circular window behind Seb and looks through the blinds.)
MATTHEW: My God.
(Missy, the Edwardian lady, walks into the corridor, looks at them then walks away.)
SEB: Sorry, she's a bit er, busy today. So, any questions?

[The Moon 2049]

(Clara is using a communications console. She and Courtney Woods, Miss Disruptive Influence, are wearing orange spacesuits from the Tardis.)
CLARA: Hello, hello. Hello, Earth. We have a terrible decision to make. It's an uncertain decision, and we don't have a lot of time. The man who normally helps, he's gone. Maybe he's not coming back. In fact, I, I really don't think he is. We're on our own. So, an innocent life versus the future of all mankind. We have forty five minutes to decide.
(Because that is how long is left on the countdown to detonation of the 100 nuclear devices within range of the trigger.)

[Coal Hill School]

(Previously, in the now time.)
CLARA: Courtney Woods. Doctor, she has gone crazy. She's uncontrollable. She took your psychic paper. She's been using it as fake ID.
DOCTOR: To get into museums?
CLARA: No, no, no. To buy White Lightning or alcopops or whatever.
DOCTOR: I've no idea what you're talking about. What, what is Courtney Woods?
CLARA: She's one of my year tens. She was in the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Doing what?
CLARA: Throwing up.
DOCTOR: Oh, her. Oh, that was ages ago.
CLARA: Look, she says that you told her that she wasn't special.
DOCTOR: Rubbish.
CLARA: She says that's what sent her off the rails.
DOCTOR: Pffff.

[Store cupboard]

(The Tardis has found a larger place than the previous supply cupboard, with glass panels in the door.)
CLARA: Doctor. I know, I know. But, you say something like that to somebody, it hurts. Especially if you're somebody of her age, especially if you're you. Doctor, it can affect her whole life.
DOCTOR: Bah.

[Tardis]

(Courtney is inside, at the console. The Doctor runs over to her.)
DOCTOR: Oi! Give over!
COURTNEY: I got stuff to clean up with.
(She holds up paper towels)
DOCTOR: What?
COURTNEY: And I got these from the chemist.
DOCTOR: Vortex manipulators?
(Magnetic bracelets on her wrists.)
COURTNEY: Travel sickness.
DOCTOR: Good. Because I don't like people being sick in my Tardis. No being sick. And no hanky-panky.
CLARA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Sorry, that's the rules.
CLARA: Look, Courtney, you're not going to be needing those because you're not going to be doing any travelling. Doctor, will you just, just tell her?
DOCTOR: Tell her what?
CLARA: (through clenched teeth) Tell her that she's special.
DOCTOR: Have you gone bananas?
COURTNEY: Do you really think I'm not special? You can't just take me away like that. It's like you kicked a big hole in in the side of my life. You really think it? I'm nothing? I'm not special?
DOCTOR: (sotto) Pfft. God. (normal) How'd you like to be the first woman on the moon? Is that special enough for you?
COURTNEY: Yeah, all right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now we can do something interesting.
(He sets the Tardis flying.)
CLARA: Hey, Doctor!

[Cargo bay]

(They step out of the Tardis in full spacesuits into a storage area filled with cylindrical objects, some in racks. Some have a US flag on them, some have Cyrillic writing.)
COURTNEY: This isn't the moon. Where are we?
DOCTOR: On a recycled space shuttle. 2049, judging by that prototype version of the Bennett oscillator.
(They take their helmets off.)
DOCTOR: Where's the gravity coming from?
CLARA: What are they?
DOCTOR: About a hundred nuclear bombs.
(An alarm sounds. The Doctor looks out through the airlock window.)
DOCTOR: Ah. We're on our way to the moon. Check that. We're about to crash into it! Hold on! Hold on!
(They grab hold of cargo nets.)
CLARA: Why didn't you just tell her you didn't mean it?
(The space shuttle belly-flops onto the moon's surface and skids to a halt. The three person shuttle crew enter, lead by a woman.)
LUNDVIK: Who the hell do you think you are?
DOCTOR: Why have you got all these nuclear bombs?
LUNDVIK: I'm not going to give you another chance.
DOCTOR: Oh? Well, you're just going to have to shoot us, then. Shoot the little girl first.
COURTNEY: What?
DOCTOR: Yes. She doesn't want to stand there watching us getting shot, does she? She'll be terrified. Girl first, then her teacher, and then me. You'll have to spend a lot of time shooting me because I will keep on regenerating.
(Courtney sits on the deck behind the big Russian bomb and sulks.)
DOCTOR: In fact, I'm not entirely sure that I won't keep on regenerating for ever.
CLARA: Doctor, what are you doing?
(The Doctor is making slow steps backwards and forwards. He ends up doing bunny hops.)
DOCTOR: Gravity test. So, it'll be very time-consuming and messy, and rather wasteful, because I think I might just possibly be able to help you. You see, I am a super-intelligent alien being who flies in time and space. Are you going to shoot me?
LUNDVIK: No.
DOCTOR: Good. Why have you got all these nuclear bombs? No, no, no. Easier question. What's wrong with my yo-yo?
(Just like the Fourth Doctor did once, he uses a yo-yo to test the gravity.)
CLARA: Doctor, it goes up and down.
DOCTOR: Bingo.
(The penny finally drops.)
CLARA: Ah.
DOCTOR: Ah ha. We should be bouncing about this cabin like little fluffy clouds. But we're not. What is the matter with the moon?
LUNDVIK: Nobody knows.
CLARA: Do you know what's wrong with the moon?
DOCTOR: It's put on weight.
LUNDVIK: How can the moon put on weight?
DOCTOR: Oh, lots of ways. Gravity bombs, axis alignment systems, planet shellers.
LUNDVIK: So it's alien.
DOCTOR: Must be causing chaos on Earth. The tides will be so high that they will drown whole cities.
LUNDVIK: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So what are you doing about it?
(Lundvik takes a case from the wall.)
DOCTOR: This?
LUNDVIK: That's what you do with aliens, isn't it? Blow them up?

[Moon]

(Helmets on, they open the airlock onto the moon's surface. Courtney goes first. Okay, it is actually Lanzarote. At least they got to go on location - to the same place as in Planet of Fire.)
COURTNEY: Wow. Wow! One small thing for a thing. One enormous thing for a thingy thing.
LUNDVIK: So much for history.
(They leave the scorched and pretty much wrecked unnamed space shuttle and walk over to a modular settlement in a nearby crater. Courtney takes her mobile phone from a pocket and takes lots of photos, as a half-Earth hangs in the sky.)
LUNDVIK: There was a mining survey, Mexicans. Something happened up here. Nobody knows what. That's when the trouble began back on Earth. High tide everywhere at once. The greatest natural disaster in history.
(They walk around the building. The airlock is wide open.)
CLARA: Cobwebs?
LUNDVIK: Henry, go back and prime the bombs.
HENRY: Er, is there any instructions?
LUNDVIK: There's a switch on each of them. The light goes red.
HENRY: They won't go off?
LUNDVIK: No, not till I fiddle with this thing.
(The red case she has kept with her since she took it off the wall. Middle-aged Henry turns back, looking worried.)
HENRY: Okay.
LUNDVIK: Shall we?
DOCTOR: Is that the best you could get?
LUNDVIK: Second-hand space shuttle, third-hand astronauts.

[Module]

(A remarkable lot of cobwebs for a building open to vacuum. They close the door to the corridor behind them.)
DOCTOR: How many people here?
LUNDVIK: Four. Minera Luna San Pedro. It was privately financed. They where doing a mineral survey up here.
DOCTOR: Messages? Mayday? SOS?
DUKE: Pretty much all the satellites had been whacked out of orbit. They managed to send back some screams.
DOCTOR: So then you came up here to rescue them with your bombs?
DUKE: Not quite.
LUNDVIK: They disappeared ten years ago.
DOCTOR: Nobody came?
LUNDVIK: There was no shuttle.
DOCTOR: You had one.
LUNDVIK: It was in a museum. They'd cut the back off it so kids could ride in it. We'd stopped going into space. Nobody cared. Not until
(Courtney screams.)
CLARA: Courtney!
(Courtney has found a spacesuit hanging in a cocoon.)
CLARA: Oh, my God. Doctor, tell me there wasn't anyone inside that thing.
(He scans it with his screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: I could, but it wouldn't make it true.
DUKE: I'll get some power back on.
CLARA: Come on. Now, Courtney, come here. Don't look. You all right?
COURTNEY: I'm okay.
(The Doctor cuts the corpse down.)
CLARA: Hey. Look. Look at me. Look. It's all right if you're not.
COURTNEY: I'm fine. What did it?
DOCTOR: Maybe something trying to find out how you're put together. Or maybe how you tasted.
COURTNEY: Do we have guns?
LUNDVIK: Not unless you brought some.
DOCTOR: Chicken, apparently.
(The settlement powers up.)
DOCTOR: Save the air.
(They take their helmets off. A few notes of that Psycho shower scene theme sound in the background. The Doctor powers up a computer console and looks at the survey records.)
DOCTOR: They didn't find anything.
LUNDVIK: Eh?
DOCTOR: The Mexicans. They didn't find any minerals on the moon at all. Nada.
(He looks at photographs of the moon strewn on a table.)
DOCTOR: Oh.
CLARA: Oh?
DOCTOR: Lines of tectonic stress.
LUNDVIK: That's the Mare Fecunditatis. It's been there since the Apollo days. It's always been there.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. These are much, much bigger. Sea of Tranquillity. Sea of Nectar. Sea of Ingenuity. Sea of Crises.
CLARA: Meaning?
(The lights flicker.)
DOCTOR: Meaning, Clara, that the moon, this little planetoid that's been tagging along beside you for a hundred million years, which gives you light at night and seas to sail on, is in the process of falling to bits.
(Bang! Everything shakes.)

(Henry, who is still on his way back to the shuttle, is knocked to his knees. He gets back up on his feet and tries to use his communicator.)
HENRY: Hello, Captain? Captain? Captain?
(Something is going on inside a nearby slit in the ground. We see him shine his torch in, then stagger backwards and fall as if something is heading for him.)
HENRY: Argh!

[Module]

(There is a high-pitched sound and a scuttling noise.)
COURTNEY: What the hell was that?
LUNDVIK: Duke, is that you?
DUKE [OC]: I don't sound anything like that.
LUNDVIK: Can you try and get the lights back on?
DUKE [OC]: That's what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: Torch. Give me your torch. Whatever it is, it's in here.
(Sounds of running claws.)
DOCTOR: I think we've found your alien.
(A giant space spider with luminous red knees heads for them down an adjoining corridor.)
DOCTOR: Back, back, back! We need a door. A door, a door!
CLARA: Here! Here! The door's locked.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on! There's no power to work it. Come on!
CLARA: Doctor.
(He drags them down behind the table.)
DOCTOR: Stay still. It's sensing movement. It can't see you. Fast movement. There must be another exit through there. Slowly. Slowly. Head to that exit. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly, slowly. (They inch their way.)
DOCTOR: Gently, gently. When I say run, run.
LUNDVIK: Who made you the boss?
DOCTOR: Well, you say run, then.
LUNDVIK: Duke!
(The giant spider leaps on Duke as he comes in from another corridor.)
DUKE: Argh!
LUNDVIK: Duke!
(The locked door opens.)
DOCTOR: Run! We have power. Run!
CLARA: Quick, it's shutting.
(The door slams shut, and Courtney is on the wrong side, because her feet are no longer in contact with the floor.)
COURTNEY: Miss!
CLARA: Courtney! Courtney!
COURTNEY: Miss!
CLARA: Courtney! The power's gone again.
(Courtney is floating in mid-air.)
COURTNEY: It's killed him. It's coming in here! Doctor, it's coming in here!
DOCTOR: You'll be okay!
(Lundvik uses her communicator.)
LUNDVIK: Henry? Henry?
DOCTOR: Courtney, look at me. Look at me! Courtney!
(The spider is walking across the ceiling.)
DOCTOR: Try and get to the door! Try and get yourself down here.
(The Doctor gets the glass pane out of the door.)
DOCTOR: Courtney, grab my yo-yo!
(She does, just as gravity returns and she drops to the floor. The spider rears over her and she screams, then reaches for something in her backpack.)
DOCTOR: Courtney!
(Courtney stands and pumps something out of a bottle at the spider. The others re-enter.)
CLARA: Courtney.
COURTNEY: Kills ninety nine percent of all known germs.
(The clean-up stuff she brought with her.)
DOCTOR: Good stuff, Courtney. Just don't try that at home, okay?
CLARA: You all right?
COURTNEY: Why did I just fly? This is nuts.
(The Doctor scans the remains of the spider with his screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: Did you say germs? Oh, God, this is incredible. Look at the size of it. It's the size of a badger.
CLARA: Doctor
DOCTOR: It's a prokaryotic unicellular life form, with non-chromosomal DNA. Which, as you and me know. Well, not you and me. Well, you, certainly not. You and me, yes, scientists know, this is a germ. You flew because that one point three billion tonnes shifted. It moved. It's an unstable mass.
COURTNEY: I'm scared, Miss.
CLARA: Okay.
(Lundvik has looked at what is left of Duke.)
LUNDVIK: He'd just had a grand-daughter. Elina. She was his first. He was my teacher. He taught me how to fly. We were both given the sack on the same day.
DOCTOR: Which way to the Mare Fecunditatis?
COURTNEY: Please can I go home now? I'm really. I'm really sorry, but I'd like to go home.

[Moon]

(The Doctor leads them in single file.)
LUNDVIK: Henry, come in. If you don't mind, Henry, come in.
CLARA: Doctor, this is dangerous now.
DOCTOR: It was dangerous before. Everything's dangerous if you want it to be. Eating chips is dangerous. Crossing the road. It's no way to live your life. Tell her. You're supposed to be teaching her.
CLARA: Look, I have a duty of care, okay? You know what that is?
DOCTOR: Course I know what a duty of care is. What are you suggesting? She's fine. What are you, thirty five?
COURTNEY: Fifteen.
(Clara shakes her head.)

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Now, don't touch anything.
COURTNEY: You got any games?
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be so stupid!
COURTNEY: Can I get reception up here?

[Cargo bay]

(Lundvik is setting the triggers on the nuclear devices.)
DOCTOR: Get in.
CLARA: Why are you shutting her in? We don't need to stay, do we?
DOCTOR: Eh?
CLARA: It's obvious, isn't it? The moon doesn't break up.
DOCTOR: How do you know?
CLARA: Because I've been in the future, and the moon is still there. I think. You know the moon is still there, right?
DOCTOR: Maybe it isn't the moon. Maybe it's a hologram or a big painting, or a special effect. Maybe it's a completely different moon.
CLARA: But you would know.
DOCTOR: I would?
CLARA: If the moon fell to bits in 2049, somebody would've mentioned it. It would have come up in conversation. So it doesn't break up. So the world doesn't end. So, let's just get in the Tardis and go.
DOCTOR: Clara, there are some moments in time that I simply can't see. Little eye-blinks. They don't look the same as other things. They're not clear. They're fuzzy, they're grey. Little moments in which big things are decided. And this is one of them. Just now, I can't tell what happens to the moon, because whatever happens to the moon hasn't been decided yet. And it's going to be decided here and now. Which very much sounds as though it's up to us.
LUNDVIK: Neither of you are going anywhere. I've lost my crew. We were the last astronauts. This is the last shuttle, these are the last nuclear bombs. We're the last chance for Earth, and you're staying to help me.
DOCTOR: Decision made.
CLARA: Yeah.
(In the Tardis, Courtney walks around with the phone, bored. She touches some controls, which burble and release a bit of steam, then she sits down.)

[Moon]

(Looking down on the Mexicans' survey and sample equipment.)
DOCTOR: What is killing the moon?
CLARA: How can the moon die, though?
DOCTOR: Everything does, sooner or later.
LUNDVIK: Can we save it?
DOCTOR: Depends what's killing it.
LUNDVIK: There are the other three.
(They go down to the spacesuits in cobwebs near cracks in the crust.)
CLARA: Is it those germ things, then? Are they like cockroaches? Is it, is it an infestation?
LUNDVIK: Is it?
DOCTOR: Well, I've only seen one of them. It would take an awful lot more to cause the moon to put on one point three billion tonnes.
(A giant spider-germ comes out of its lair next to a spacesuit and jumps the Doctor.)
DOCTOR: Argh!
CLARA: Doctor!
(Clara tries the disinfectant spray.)
LUNDVIK: It's a vacuum. It won't work.
(They grab at its legs and get it off the Doctor's faceplate. It scuttles back into its lair.)
DOCTOR: Well, that makes two.
CLARA: Sunlight.
LUNDVIK: Sunlight?
CLARA: If they're germs. My nan says it's the best disinfectant there is.
DOCTOR: Shine your light down there.
(Lundvik does. There are lots of the red-kneed germs.)
LUNDVIK: Where have they come from?
DOCTOR: Maybe they've been there all the time. It's warmish. They're multiplying, feeding, evolving.
(They leave, rapidly.)
LUNDVIK: Doctor, if the moon breaks up, it'll kill us all in about forty five minutes.
DOCTOR: I agree. Unless something else is going on.
(He uses his yo-yo to get a sample from another fissure. It comes back wet)
LUNDVIK: There's no water on the moon.
DOCTOR: It's not water. It's amniotic fluid. The stuff that life comes from. I've got to go down there.
LUNDVIK: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Back to your shuttle. Get your bombs ready. You, get to the Tardis. Get safe. Get Courtney safe. I will be back.
(He takes germ killer spray from Clara.)
CLARA: What? No. Doctor. Doctor!
(The Doctor jumps down into the fissure.)
CLARA: Doctor!
LUNDVIK: Will he?
(Clara raises her arms in surrender, then lowers them and sighs.)
LUNDVIK: Will he be back?
CLARA: If he says so, I suppose he will.

[Tardis]

COURTNEY: Miss? Come in.
CLARA [OC]: Courtney?
COURTNEY: I'm bored. When are you coming back?
CLARA [OC]: We're on our way. What you doing?
COURTNEY: Putting some pictures on Tumblr.
(She flicks through pictures of the Doctor and Clara in space suits on her phone.)

[Moon]

CLARA: No! Courtney, don't put any photos on Tumblr.
LUNDVIK: My granny used to put things on Tumblr.
(A small moonquake makes them stagger.)
LUNDVIK: There he is.
(They have reached Henry. His helmet is open to the vacuum and he is a skeleton now. Clara looks across at the shuttle, on the opposite side of a ravine.)
CLARA: Was that where we landed? It looks so different.
(Cracks form in the moon's crust.)
LUNDVIK: It's going down.
(The shuttle tumbles into the widening ravine.)
CLARA: Courtney! Doctor!
LUNDVIK: We going to have to take cover. We're running out of oxygen.
CLARA: Doctor!
(He appears behind them.)
DOCTOR: Today's the day, humankind.

[Module]

CLARA: Where's the Tardis?
DOCTOR: She's in the shuttle, isn't she? She'll turn up.
CLARA: Last time you said that, she turned up on the wrong side of the planet.
DOCTOR: You two have never gotten on, have you?
CLARA: Look, we need to know where Courtney is.
DOCTOR: Courtney is safe. Och. Well, do you have her phone number?
CLARA: No, no, no. Of course I don't have her phone number.
DOCTOR: Well, what about the school? Does the secretary have her number?
CLARA: I can't. The secretary hates me. She thinks I gave her a packet of TENA Lady for Secret Santa. Look. Courtney's posting stuff on Tumblr. Doesn't that know where you are?
LUNDVIK: I don't know. I'm not a historian.
DOCTOR: Phone. I know what the problem is. Oh, she can't post that. She can't put pictures of me online.
(He sonicks Clara's phone then aims at a monitor up on the wall. Shades of the Three Doctors.)
COURTNEY [on monitor]: Yeah?
DOCTOR: You can't put pictures of me online.
CLARA: Are you okay?
COURTNEY [on monitor]: Er, I'm fine. What's up?
LUNDVIK: You said you know what the problem is.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. It's a rather big problem.
CLARA: Okay,.do you want to share it with the class?
DOCTOR: Well, I had a little hypothesis. The seismic activity, the surface breaking up, the variable mass, the increase in gravity, the fluid. I scanned what's down there.
(He moves a mobile console and sonicks it, then creates a 3D projection of the moon.)
DOCTOR: The moon isn't breaking apart. Well, actually, it is breaking apart, and rather quickly. We've got about an hour and a half. But that isn't the problem. It's not infested.
COURTNEY [on monitor]: What are they, then, those things?
DOCTOR: Bacteria. Tiny, tiny bacteria living on something very, very big. Something that weighs about one point three billion tonnes. Something that's living. Something growing.
CLARA: Growing?
DOCTOR: That.
(He sonicks the image to show what looks very like a baby dragon curled up inside the moon.)
COURTNEY [on monitor]: That lives under the moon?
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: That doesn't live under the moon. That is the moon.
LUNDVIK: What the hell are you talking about?
DOCTOR: The moon isn't breaking apart. The moon is hatching.
CLARA: Huh?
DOCTOR: The moon's an egg.
CLARA: Has it, er, has it always been an egg?
DOCTOR: Yes, for a hundred million years or so. Just, just growing. Just getting ready to be born.
CLARA: Okay. So the moon has never been the moon?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. It's never been dead. It's just taking a long time to come alive.
COURTNEY [on monitor]: Is it a chicken?
DOCTOR: No!
COURTNEY [on monitor]: Cos, for a chicken to have laid an egg that big 
DOCTOR: Courtney, don't spoil the moment.
CLARA: Doctor, what is it?
DOCTOR: I think that it's unique. I think that's the only one of its kind in the universe. I think that that is utterly beautiful.
LUNDVIK: How do we kill it?
CLARA: Why'd you want to kill it?
COURTNEY [on monitor]: It's a little baby.
LUNDVIK: Doctor, how do we kill it?
DOCTOR: Kill the moon?
(Lundvik nods. He turns off the hologram.)
DOCTOR: Kill the moon. Well, you have about a hundred of the best man-made nuclear weapons, if they still work. If that's what you want to do.
CLARA: Doctor, wait
LUNDVIK: Will that do it?
DOCTOR: A hundred nuclear bombs set off right where we are, right on top of a living, vulnerable creature? It'll never feel the sun on its back.
LUNDVIK: And then what? Will the moon still break up? You said, you said we had an hour and a half?
DOCTOR: Well, there'll be nothing to make it break up. There will be nothing trying to force its way out. The gravity of the little dead baby will pull all the pieces back together again. Of course, it won't be very pretty. You'd have an enormous corpse floating in the sky. You might have some very difficult conversations to have with your kids.
LUNDVIK: I don't have any kids.
CLARA: Stop. Right, listen. This is a, this is a life. I mean, this must be the biggest life in the universe.
COURTNEY [on monitor]: It's not even been born.
LUNDVIK: It is killing people. It is destroying the Earth.
CLARA: You cannot blame a baby for kicking.
LUNDVIK: Let me tell you something. You want to know what I took back from being in space? Look at the edge of the Earth. The atmosphere, that is paper thin. That is the only thing that saves us all from death. Everything else, the stars, the blackness. That's all dead. Sadly, that is the only life any of us will ever know.
COURTNEY [on monitor]: There's life here. There's life just next door.
LUNDVIK: Look, when you've grown up a bit, you'll realise that everything doesn't have to be nice. Some things are just bad. Anyway, you ran away. It's none of your business.
COURTNEY [on monitor]: Doctor, I want to come back.
CLARA: Courtney, you'll be safer where you are.
(Lundvik enters the code to start the countdown on the bombs.)

[Tardis]

COURTNEY: Doctor, I'm sorry. I want to come back, okay? I want to help.
DOCTOR [OC]: Ah, there's some DVDs on the blue book shelf.

[Module]

DOCTOR: Just stick one into the Tardis console. That'll bring you to me.
COURTNEY [on monitor]: Right.
DOCTOR: And make sure you hang on to the console, otherwise the Tardis will leave you behind.
CLARA: So what do we do? Doctor? Huh? Doctor, what do we do?
DOCTOR: Nothing.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: We don't do anything. I'm sorry, Clara. I can't help you.
CLARA: Of course you can help.
DOCTOR: The Earth isn't my home. The moon's not my moon. Sorry.
CLARA: Come on. Hey.
DOCTOR: Listen, there are moments in every civilisation's history in which the whole path of that civilisation is decided. The whole future path. Whatever future humanity might have depends upon the choice that is made right here and right now. Now, you've got the tools to kill it. You made them. You brought them up here all on your own, with your own ingenuity. You don't need a Time Lord. Kill it. Or let it live. I can't make this decision for you.
CLARA: Yeah, well, I can't make it.
DOCTOR: Well, there's two of you here.
CLARA: Well, yeah. A school teacher and an astronaut.
DOCTOR: Who's better qualified?
CLARA: I don't know! The President of America.
DOCTOR: Oh, take something off his plate. He makes far too many decisions anyway.
LUNDVIK: She.
DOCTOR: She. Sorry. She hasn't even been into space. She hasn't been to another planet. How would she even know what to do?
CLARA: I am asking you for help.
DOCTOR: Listen, we went to dinner in Berlin in 1937, right? We didn't nip out after pudding and kill Hitler. I've never killed Hitler. And you wouldn't expect me to kill Hitler. The future is no more malleable than the past.
CLARA: Okay, don't you do this to make some kind of point.
DOCTOR: Sorry. Well, actually, no, I'm not sorry. It's time to take the stabilisers off your bike. It's your moon, womankind. It's your choice.
CLARA: And you're just going to stand there?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not.
(The Tardis arrives, and Courtney comes out.)
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: A teenager, an astronaut and a schoolteacher.
LUNDVIK: Hang on a minute. We can get in there, can't we? You can sort it out with that thing.
DOCTOR: No. Some decisions are too important not to make on your own.
CLARA: Doctor. Doctor? Doctor!
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis and shuts the door. It dematerialises.)
LUNDVIK: Oh, what a prat.
(Another moonquake. The germs come flooding onto the surface from new fissures.)
LUNDVIK: I'm going to detonate the bombs, agreed? Agreed?
(A porthole breaks and the air rushes out.)
LUNDVIK: Hang on tight, there's been a breach!
(The vacuum sucks a handy piece of metal over the hole and seals it.)
CLARA: If we let it live, what would happen if the moon wasn't there?
LUNDVIK: Listen, we haven't got time for this.
CLARA: We're discussing it! What would happen if the moon wasn't there?
COURTNEY: I have a physics book in my bag. There's this thing on gravity?
LUNDVIK: Super. Is there a word search?
CLARA: Okay, there would be no tides. But we'd survive that, right? They've knocked out the satellites. There's no internet, no mobiles. I'd be fine with that.
LUNDVIK: It's not going to just stop being there, because inside the moon, Miss, is a gigantic creature forcing its way out. And when it does, which is going to be pretty damn soon, there are going to be huge chunks of the moon heading right for us, like whatever killed the dinosaurs, only ten thousand times bigger.
CLARA: But the moon isn't make of rock and stone, is it? It's made of eggshell.
LUNDVIK: Oh, God. Okay, okay, fine. If, by some miracle, the shell isn't too thick, or if it disperses, or if it goes into orbit, whatever, there's still going to be a massive thing there, isn't there, that just popped out. And what the hell do you imagine that is?
COURTNEY: Loads of things lay eggs.
LUNDVIK: It's not a chicken.
COURTNEY: I'm not saying it's a chicken. I'm not completely stupid.
LUNDVIK: It's an exoparasite.
COURTNEY: A what?
LUNDVIK: Like a flea. Or a head louse.
CLARA: I'm going to have to be a lot more certain than that if I'm going to kill a baby.
LUNDVIK: Oh, you want to talk about babies?. You've probably got babies down there now. You want to have babies?
CLARA: Well, yeah.
COURTNEY: Mister Pink.
CLARA: Shush!
LUNDVIK: Okay. You imagine you've got children down there on Earth now, right? Grandchildren maybe. You want that thing to get out? Kill them all? You want today to be the day life on Earth stopped because you couldn't make an unfair decision? Listen, I don't want to do this. All my life I've dreamed about coming here. But this is how it has to end.
(Lundvik sets the trigger.)
COURTNEY: Oi!
LUNDVIK: I've given us an hour. There's a cut-out here. If anyone has any bright ideas, or if he comes back, that stops it. But once it's pressed, it stays pressed.
CLARA: And if he doesn't come back?
LUNDVIK: I didn't expect to survive anyway.
COURTNEY: He's going to come back, though, right? Isn't he, Miss?
CLARA: Hey, why don't you call me Clara?
COURTNEY: I prefer Miss, Miss. We just need to make up our minds, that's all. Well, you know him.
CLARA: I think he really might just be leaving it to us.
(The communications system on the computer console crackles.)
MCKEAN [OC]: Can anybody hear me? Come in, please. Can anybody 
LUNDVIK: Lundvik.
MCKEAN [on monitor]: This is ground control.
LUNDVIK: Yeah, yeah, I can tell by your haircut. How are things down there?
MCKEAN [on monitor]: Pretty bad. Yeah. Pretty bad. Listen, we're patched in to one of the TV satellites. We haven't got long. How are things up there?
CLARA: Can we broadcast on this?
MCKEAN [on monitor]: Who are you?
CLARA: School trip. Can we broadcast on this?
MCKEAN [on monitor]: Well, yes.
(And now we have caught up to the teaser.)
CLARA: Hello, Earth. We have a terrible decision to make. It's an uncertain decision and we don't have a lot of time. We can kill this creature or we can let it live. We don't know what it's going to do, we don't know what's going to happen when it hatches. If it will hurt us, help us, or just leave us alone. We have to decide together. This is the last time we'll be able to speak to you, but you can send us a message. If you think we should kill the creature, turn your lights off. If you think we should take the chance, let it live, leave your lights on. We'll be able to see. Goodnight, Earth.
(Transmission ends.)
CLARA: Was that okay?
COURTNEY: Yeah.
(Bang! The lights flicker. Clara takes Courtney's hand.)
CLARA: Come on. Let's see.
(Lundvik picks up the trigger case and they walk along a corridor. The moon shakes and the power fluctuates. They run to a porthole as something explodes in flames behind them, and Clara looks out at the Earth with a small pair of binoculars. The only visible artificial lights are of course Europe and the Americas. Africa, Asia and Australia don't get a vote in this. Thirty nine minutes to go, then thirty two. Lights go out across the world. Eighteen minutes, five. The planet finishes going dark.)
COURTNEY: Night, night.
CLARA: Oh, Doctor, where have you gone?
LUNDVIK: We can't risk it all just to be nice.
CLARA: Okay.
COURTNEY: Miss?
LUNDVIK: Nine seconds.
COURTNEY: You can't!
LUNDVIK: Sorry, girls. See you on the other side. Two
(Clara hits the cut-out switch. Detonation aborted.)
LUNDVIK: Hey!
(The Tardis materialises.)
DOCTOR: One, two, three, into the Tardis.
LUNDVIK: What's happening?
DOCTOR: Let's go and have a look, shall we?

[Tardis]

(The Doctor sets the Tardis flying.)
LUNDVIK: Bloody idiots. Bloody irresponsible idiots.
(The Doctor walks over to her.)
DOCTOR: Mind your language, please, There are children present.
LUNDVIK: You should have left me there, let me die. I wanted to die up there with the universe in front of me, not being crushed to death on Earth.
DOCTOR: Nobody's going to die.
LUNDVIK: Could you please let us see what's happening?

[Beach]

(The Tardis lands on a Lanzarote beach below a full moon in a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The moon is falling apart as the baby spreads its wings.)
COURTNEY: What's it doing?
(There is a faint image of a giant winged creature in the sky, making noises.)
DOCTOR: It's feeling the sun on itself. It's getting warm. The chick flies away and the eggshell disintegrates. Harmless.
CLARA: Did you know?
DOCTOR: You made your decision. Humanity made its choice.
LUNDVIK: No, we ignored humanity.
DOCTOR: Well, there you go.
LUNDVIK: So what happens now, then? Tell me what happens now.
(The Doctor turns his back on them and closes his eyes briefly.)
DOCTOR: In the mid-twenty first century humankind starts creeping off into the stars, spreads its way through the galaxy to the very edges of the universe. And it endures till the end of time.
(He turns back to them,)
DOCTOR: And it does all that because one day in the year 2049, when it had stopped thinking about going to the stars, something occurred that make it look up, not down. It looked out there into the blackness and it saw something beautiful, something wonderful, that for once it didn't want to destroy. And in that one moment, the whole course of history was changed. Not bad for a girl from Coal Hill School, and her teacher.
COURTNEY: Oh, my gosh. It laid a new egg. It's beautiful. Doctor, it's beautiful.
DOCTOR: That's what we call a new moon.
(A blank white round thing in the sky waiting for fresh meteorites to start decorating its surface.)
COURTNEY: You can be the first woman on that.
DOCTOR: I think that somebody deserves a thank you.
LUNDVIK: Yeah, probably. (to Clara) Thank you. Thank you for stopping me. Thank you for giving me the moon back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Captain. Well, you've got a whole new space programme to get together. NASA is er, it's that way. About two and a half thousand miles. (to Courtney) You still got your vortex manipulators? I'll give you a run home.

[Tardis]

(Courtney and Clara come back upstairs from below the console after getting changed back into their school clothes. The Doctor is dropping books on the steps to the gallery.)
DOCTOR: Not that it's any of my business, but I think you did the right thing.
CLARA: Yeah, you're right. It's none of your business. Come on, Courtney, off you go. Double Geography.
COURTNEY: Can we do it again?
CLARA: Go. Go, go. Chop chop.
(Courtney leaves the Tardis, and the Doctor sets it flying. Clara stops it.)
CLARA: Tell me what you knew.
DOCTOR: Nothing. I told you, I've got grey areas.
CLARA: Yeah. I noticed. Tell me what you knew, Doctor, or else I'll smack you so hard you'll regenerate.
DOCTOR: I knew that eggs are not bombs. I know they don't usually destroy their nests. Essentially, what I knew was that you would always make the best choice. I had faith that you would always make the right choice.
CLARA: Honestly, do you have music playing in your head when you say rubbish like that?
DOCTOR: It wasn't my decision to make. I told you.
CLARA: Well, why did you do it? Was it for Courtney, was that it?
DOCTOR: Well, she really is something special now, isn't she? First woman on the moon, saved the Earth from itself, and, rather bizarrely, she becomes the President of the United States. She met this bloke called Blinovitch
(Check out the Blinovitch Limitation Effect on Tardis.Wikia.com)
CLARA: Do you know what? Shut up! I am so sick of listening to you!
DOCTOR: Well, I didn't do it for Courtney. I didn't know what was going to happen. Do you think I'm lying?
(Clara is crying with rage.)
CLARA: I don't know. I don't know. If you didn't do it for her, I mean. Do you know what? It was, it was cheap, it was pathetic. No, no, no. It was patronising. That was you patting us on the back, saying, you're big enough to go to the shops by yourself now. Go on, toddle along.
DOCTOR: No, that was me allowing you to make a choice about your own future. That was me respecting you.
CLARA: Oh, my God, really? Was it? Yeah, well, respected is not how I feel.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Er.
CLARA: I nearly didn't press that button. I nearly got it wrong. That was you, my friend, making me scared. Making me feel like a bloody idiot.
DOCTOR: Language.
CLARA: Oh, don't you ever tell me to mind my language. Don't you ever tell me to take the stabilisers off my bike. And don't you dare lump me in with the rest of all the little humans that you think are so tiny and silly and predictable. You walk our Earth, Doctor, you breathe our air. You make us your friend, and that is your moon too. And you can damn well help us when we need it.
DOCTOR: I was helping.
CLARA: What, by clearing off?
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: Yeah, well, clear off! Go on. You can clear off. Get back in your lonely, your lonely bloody Tardis and you don't come back.
DOCTOR: Clara. Clara.
CLARA: You go away. Okay? You go a long way away.
(Clara slams the door shut behind her. The Tardis dematerialises as she leaves the store cupboard, leaving a few papers flying around in the resulting breeze as the air rushes into the hole it has left.)

(The study book this time is David Copperfield, according to the white board.)
DANNY: Hello.
CLARA: Hey. Now then.
DANNY: What've you been up to?
CLARA: The usual.
DANNY: It happened, didn't it?
(A little later, after she has told it all from her point of view.)
CLARA: Well, he was wrong, wasn't he? Wasn't he? Danny, what do you think?
DANNY: I think I've seen this look before.
CLARA: No, you haven't. This is new for me.
DANNY: No, not on your face. On mine.
CLARA: What did you do?
DANNY: I left the army.
CLARA: You loved the army.
DANNY: Yep. And then one day I didn't.
CLARA: I'm done, I'm done. I am finished with it. I am, I am, I'm done. It's over. I'm finished with him, and I told him that. What is that face for? Why don't you believe me?
DANNY: Because you're still angry. You can never finish with anyone while they can still make you angry. Tell him when you're calm, and then tell me.
(Clara hugs him.)
CLARA: When did you get to become so wise?
DANNY: Same way as anyone else. I had a really bad day.
(Clara goes home with her shopping and pours herself a glass of red wine, then looks out of the window at the impossibly big full moon with exactly the same crater markings as the old one.)


(Images of the number 66, an incandescent light bulb fickers, then a traditional horror film mummy is roaring and reaching for us -)
DOCTOR [OC]: Start the clock.

[Restaurant coach]

(The numbers count down near the bottom of the screen. A young woman in traditional black and white maids uniform walks down the central aisle of a steam train's restaurant coach. It is the 1920s, and the whistle blows. At 52 seconds, an old woman looks up, then lowers her lorgnette and speaks to the fashionable young lady opposite.)
MRS PITT: Is there some sort of fancy dress thing on this evening?
MAISIE: I don't think so. Why do you ask?
MRS PITT: Well, that fellow over there, dressed as a mummy monster thing.
MAISIE: Who do you mean? I can't see him.
(The mummy reaches for Mrs Pitt. She summons the head waiter.)
MRS PITT: You! You! Throw that man out of my dining car. It's disgusting.
WAITER: I'm sorry, Madam. Which man?
MRS PITT: Which man?! I'll have your job. That man, right there, dressed as a monster.
(The head waiter walks away.)
MAISIE: Mama, there isn't anyone there. Are you feeling okay?
MRS PITT: Don't you dare lie to me, girl. I won't be made a fool of. Stop it. Stop it. Stop him at once. Right now.
MAISIE: Mama, there's no one there. You're worrying me. Do you want one of your pills?
MRS PITT: Oh, no! Get it off! Get it off!
(Zero. The mummy puts its hands Mrs Pitt's head and she goes limp. Maisie stands up.)
MAISIE: Oh! Is there a doctor? Sorry, I need a doctor. Sorry, I don't know. She just, she just stopped.
(A man comes over to check on Mrs Pitt as the steam whistle blows. The camera moves back through the window to show us the name of the train - Orient Express - as it hurtles on through space.)

[Baggage car]

(The Tardis materialises in a space at the back of the car, amidst racks of suitcases, and the Doctor steps out wearing a black suit with a white handkerchief in the breast pocket and a loose bow tie with very long ends, sort of Western style. He holds out his hand to his companion, a fashionable flapper with jaw-length bobbed hair.)
DOCTOR: Your train awaits, my lady.
CLARA: Wonderful.
DOCTOR: The baggage car. But thanks for lying. The real wonderful is through here.
(The train's bell rings. Music is coming from nearby.)
DOCTOR: There were many trains to take the name Orient Express, but only one in space.

[Lounge]

(Comfortable chairs down the side of the carriage, a bar at one end, and armed men standing guard. The band is playing a slow jazz version of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The singer is a young lady called Foxes, so that's what I'll call her instead of just Singer.)
CLARA: Of course it is.
FOXES: (sings) So don't stop me now.
DOCTOR: Completely faithful recreation of the original Orient Express. Except slightly bigger. And in space. Oh, and the rails are actually hyperspace ribbons. But in every other respect, identical. Painstaking attention to detail.
(A man with a bald head, big red beard and steampunk eyepatch barges in between them.)
FOXES: (sings) I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
DOCTOR: Most of the time.
(The Doctor rubs his bruised arm.)
FOXES: (sings) On a collision course I am a satellite, I'm out of control. I'm a sex machine ready to reload. Like an atom bomb about to oh, oh, oh
DOCTOR: You're doing it again.
CLARA: Doing what?
DOCTOR: The smile.
CLARA: Yeah, I'm smiling.
DOCTOR: It's the sad smile. It's a smile but you're sad. It's confusing. It's like two emotions at once. It's like you're malfunctioning.
CLARA: Sorry.
FOXES: (sings) Travelling at the speed of light. Wanna make a supersonic woman of you.
DOCTOR: I just thought this would be a good one to
CLARA: To end it. Yeah. It is. It's a good choice. A good one to end on.
DOCTOR: Yeah?
CLARA: Mmm hmm.
DOCTOR: Shall we?
(The maid approaches with a tray of champagne flutes. The Doctor offers Clara his arm.)
CLARA: Mmm hmm,.
FOXES: (sings) Gimme a call. Don't stop me now Don't stop me.
(An indicator changes from a monocle to a thumbs up with a ting! The onboard computer speaks.)
GUS: Ladies and gentlemen. If you would be good enough to look from the windows on the right of the train, you'll be able to see the soaring majesty of the Magellan black hole.
DOCTOR: Oh, I remember when this was all planets as far as the eye could see. All gone now. Gobbled up by that beast. And there's that smile again. I don't even know how you do that. CLARA: I really thought I hated you, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, thank God you kept that to yourself. There was this planet, Obsidian. The planet of perpetual darkness.
CLARA: I did. I did hate you. In fact, I hated you for weeks.
DOCTOR: Good, fine. Well, I'm glad that we cleared that up. There was also a planet that was made completely of shrubs.
CLARA: I went to a concert once. Can't remember who it was. But do you know what the singer said?
DOCTOR: Frankly, that would be an absolutely astonishing guess if I did know.
CLARA: She said, "hatred is too strong an emotion to waste on someone that you don't like."
(I thought that was a Sixto Rodriguez quote, but don't mind me.)
DOCTOR: Were people really confused? Cos I'm confused. Did everybody leave?
CLARA: Shush. Shut up. Look, what I'm trying to say is, I don't hate you. I could never hate you. But I can't do this any more. Not the way you do it.
DOCTOR: Can I talk about the planets now?
CLARA: Yes. Go.
DOCTOR: Thedion Four. Constant acid rain. Had a lovely picnic there once, wearing a gas mask.
MAISIE: That's a lie.
CLARA: I'm sorry?
MAISIE: That's a lie, what you said. Thedion Four was destroyed thousands of years ago, so you couldn't have been there.
(The chief train guard comes over. He wears a uniform with two medals, lots of gold frogging and has a gun in a holster.)
QUELL: Miss Pitt, are you sure you wouldn't rather rest in your room?
MAISIE: That man's a liar.
QUELL: Perhaps you'd allow Mister Carlyle here to escort you back.
(Another uniformed guard.)
CARLYLE: It'll be all right, miss. Just come with me.
QUELL: Sorry about that. I suppose it's understandable in the circumstances. I don't believe we've been introduced. Captain Quell.
CLARA: I'm Clara. This is the Doctor.
QUELL: Ah, another one.
CLARA: Sorry? Another what?
QUELL: Well, we've got doctors and professors coming out of our ears on this trip. So, what are you a doctor of?
DOCTOR: Now, there's a question that's never asked often enough. Let's say intestinal parasites.
QUELL: I'm beginning to think Miss Pitt was right about you.
CLARA: What's wrong with her? Did something happen?
QUELL: You mean you really don't know?

[Corridor]

(They take their champagne out into the corridor to talk.)
CLARA: There's a body and there's a mummy. I mean, can you not just get on a train? Did a wizard put a curse on you about mini-breaks?
DOCTOR: It might be nothing. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically their job description.
CLARA: And the monster?
DOCTOR: Well, seen by no one except her, which suggests that it wasn't there. A dying brain, lack of oxygen, hallucinations. Anyway, people do just die sometimes. She was over a hundred years old.
CLARA: Says the two thousand year old man.
DOCTOR: Clara, you actually sound as if you want this to be a thing. Do you?
CLARA: No. No, look, fine. You know, if you think that there is nothing to worry about, then that is fine by me.
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
CLARA: Ah, yes, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: To our last hurrah.
CLARA: Our last, yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm never going to see you again.
DOCTOR: Isn't it?
CLARA: Is it?
DOCTOR: I thought that's what you wanted.
CLARA: No, what I mean, you're going to come round for dinner or something, aren't you? Do you, do you do that? Do you come round to people's houses for dinner?
DOCTOR: Of course. Why wouldn't I do that?
CLARA: I don't know. I thought you might find it boring.
DOCTOR: Is it boring?
CLARA: No.
(She raises her champagne flute.)
CLARA: To the last hurrah.
DOCTOR: The last hurrah.
(Clink.)

[Doctor's sleeping compartment]

(The Doctor is lying down on his bed. He flexes his fingers and argues with himself.)
DOCTOR: It's nothing. Nothing. Definitely. Sure. Ninety nine percent sure. Really? Ninety nine percent? That's quite high. Is that the figure you're sticking with? Okay, okay. Seventy five. Well, that's jumped quite a bit. You've just lost twenty four percent.

[Clara's sleeping compartment]

(Clara is in her room, in silk pajamas and making a phone call.)
DANNY [OC]: A train in space? Sounds pretty cool.
CLARA: So, what are you saying? Just because he brought me somewhere cool, I shouldn't dump him?

[Danny's flat]

(He's ready for bed, too.)
DANNY: Well, one, you can't dump him because he's not your boyfriend.

[Clara's sleeping compartment]

DANNY [OC]: And two, dumping him sounds a little scorched earth.

[Danny's flat]

DANNY: You still basically get on.

[Clara's sleeping compartment]

DANNY [OC]: I think you should just enjoy your space

[Danny's flat]

DANNY: Train. At least it's not dangerous.

[Clara's sleeping compartment]

CLARA: Yeah. It's pretty boring, really.

[Doctor's sleeping compartment]

DOCTOR: Because you know what this sounds like, don't you? No, do tell me. A mummy that only the victim can see. I was being rhetorical. I know exactly what this sounds like.
(He puts on his jacket and goes out into the corridor. )

[Corridor]

(The Doctor hesitates outside Clara's door, nearly knocks, then walks on. Clara comes out and knocks on the Doctor's door.)
CLARA (whispering): Doctor, are you awake?

[Engineer's carriage]

(Computer screens above a workbench, blueprints on a draughting table. Racks of tools. The Doctor finds a piece of equipment bubbling to itself, and apparently powering up according to the display. He removes the plastic wrapping and scans it with the screwdriver. The Chief Engineer startles him.)
PERKINS: Beautiful bit of kit, isn't it, sir? The Excelsior Life Extender. It's like driving around in a portable hospital.
(Perkins is holding a heavy piece of metal.)
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it didn't do Mrs Pitt much good, did it?
PERKINS: Got me there, sir. Certainly got me there. Maybe it malfunctioned.
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. The records show that the machine did everything it could to keep her alive.
PERKINS: Yeah. And almost drained the battery doing it.
DOCTOR: What do you know?
PERKINS: Well, I know that when I find a man fiddling with a chair that someone died in, it's best to play my cards close to my chest.
DOCTOR: Really? Well, I know that when I find a man loitering near a chair that someone died in, I do just the same.
PERKINS: Perkins. Chief Engineer.
DOCTOR: The Doctor. Nosey Parker.
PERKINS: (chuckles) Pleased to meet you, Doctor.
(They shake hands.)
PERKINS: Course, there's a rumour that someone or some thing else might be responsible.

[Corridor]

(Clara has got dressed and come out of her sleeping compartment again. She meets Maisie walking along in her pajamas and holding her right shoe in her hand, and follows her.)
CLARA: Hello? Are you okay? Hello? Excuse me? Excuse me?

[Baggage car]

CLARA: Miss Pitt, wasn't it? Are you all right? Do you need some help?
MAISIE: My name's Maisie. I'm not mad.
CLARA: Oh, okay. Er, I didn't say you were, but you've had a bad day. I think anybody could do with a little bit of help after a day like today.
(Maisie addresses the panel next to a heavy door at the end of the baggage car. It is labelled Private Company Property)
MAISIE: Computer, open the door.
GUS: Call me Gus. I'm afraid this door can only be opened by executive order.
(The thumbs down icon makes a sad noise.)
CLARA: Are you okay?
(Maisie cries as she tries pressing buttons on the keypad.)
MAISIE: They won't let me see her body. They should let me see her body, shouldn't they?
CLARA: Er, yeah, I should think so. It's in there, is it? Okay, I have a friend who's really good with locks. Do you want to come with me, see if we can find him?
MAISIE: Oh!
(Maisie slams the heel of her shoe into the door key pad and shorts it out. The icon changes to a telescope on a tripod, then the thumbs down, then cannot make up its mind. The door opens.)
CLARA: Or you could do that because that works, too.
(Clara follows Maisie into the room and the door closes behind them.)

[Lounge]

(The Doctor walks up to a man with a thin moustache who is reading a book, and points at him.)
DOCTOR: What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
MOORHOUSE: I'm terribly sorry, I don't believe we've met.
DOCTOR: You know. The Foretold. Mythical mummy. Legend has it that if you see it, you're a dead man.
MOORHOUSE: Yes, I know what it is. You see, I happen to be
DOCTOR: Emil Moorhouse, professor of alien mythology. I'm the Doctor. Pleased to meet you. So, the most interesting thing about the Foretold. Go.
(The Doctor sits down on the other side of Moorhouse's small table.)
MOORHOUSE: Er, well, it would have to be the time limit given before it kills you. I can't think of another myth where it's so specific. How does it go? Er, The number of evil twice over. They that bear the Foretold's stare have sixty six seconds to live.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Nice try. Very atmospheric. But that's not it. Try again.
MOORHOUSE: A cynical man might say that you were trying to pump me for information.
DOCTOR: The myth of the Foretold first appeared over five thousand years ago. In some stories, there is a riddle or secret word that is supposed to make it stop. Some characters try to bargain with it, offer riches, confess sins. All to no avail.
(The Doctor opens the silver cigarette case he has taken from his jacket pocket and offers the Professor a jelly baby.)
MOORHOUSE: Well, you certainly know a little mythology.
DOCTOR: I know a lot. Because, from time to time, it turns out to be true.

[Galley]

(The light flickers, the clock starts ticking, and the chef sees the mummy.)
CHEF: What is that?
CHEF 2: What?
CHEF: What is that?

[Lounge]

MOORHOUSE: But that's the great appeal, isn't it?

[Galley]

CHEF: Can't you see?

[Saloon car]

MOORHOUSE: Earth legends are such dry, dusty affairs, and always fiction. But up here, in the stars,

[Galley]

(The unfortunate chef tries to use trolleys to stop the mummy from getting to him.)
CHEF 2: What are you talking about?
CHEF: Get it away!

[Saloon car]

MOORHOUSE: Anything's possible. That's why I chose this field, to be honest. Hoping one day I might meet a real monster.
DOCTOR: Isn't that everyone's dream? But you still haven't answered my riddle. What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
MOORHOUSE: Well, you can't run from it, that's for sure. There are accounts of people trying, but it never works. No matter how far you run, it's always right there behind you.

[Galley]

CHEF 2: There's nothing there!
CHEF: Can't you see it?
CHEF 3: Calm down.
(The chef grabs a big knife.)
CHEF: Get it away! Get it away!
CHEF 2: What's wrong with him?
CHEF: Get it away! Get it away!
(At 18 seconds he retreats into the freezer.)
CHEF: Get it away! Get it away!
CHEF 2: What is going on?
CHEF 3: Stumpy, open the door.
CHEF 2: Yeah, open the door.
(The mummy is inside the freezer, behind him.)
CHEF 2: Get out!
CHEF: Argh!
CHEF 2: He's unhinged!
(2, 1, the mummy reaches for the chef's head and he screams.)
CHEF 2: No! Stumpy!

[Saloon car]

DOCTOR: Nope. Even colder.
MOORHOUSE: All right, I give up, you tell me.
DOCTOR: Mrs Pitt, the old woman who died.
MOORHOUSE: She died of old age. Nothing supernatural.
DOCTOR: No. That's my answer.
MOORHOUSE: Her death?
DOCTOR: No. The fact that you were here to witness it.
(There is a commotion behind them.)
DOCTOR: Excuse me, Professor.
QUELL: In which carriage?

[Galley]

(The body of the chef is scanned in the freezer as Captain Quell lays down the law to the surviving staff.)
QUELL: It was a heart attack. And if I hear anyone spreading rumours to the contrary, they'll be getting off at the next station, termination papers in hand. Are we clear?
(The chef is zipped into his white body bag.)

[Strong room]

(Clara is taking the door lock apart and moving wires around. The only light is through the grill over a window.)
MAISIE: Do you know what you're doing?
CLARA: Nope. But I do need to be slightly more skilled than a high-heeled shoe.
MAISIE: Do you ever wish bad things on people?
CLARA: Oh, yeah. All the time. Whoever designed this door, for a start.
MAISIE: She wasn't really my mum. She just made me call her that. She was my gran. Do you know why I wanted to see her body?
CLARA: Because you loved her very much and were missing her?
MAISIE: (chuckles) No. You obviously never met her. No, I just felt really guilty. Like I'd been picturing her dying for years. Like a daydream. Not really meaning it. At least, I don't think I did. But now, it just feels like I made this happen.
(Clara abandons the lock.)
CLARA: Hey, listen. You didn't do anything wrong. Difficult people, they can make you feel all sorts of things. But you didn't do it. You didn't kill her. She just died.
MAISIE: Are you sure about that?
(They look at a large iron maiden or sarcophagus thing standing at the far end of the strong room. It has a large red shiny oval where the head would be and a single small red light.)

[Corridor]

DOCTOR: I think we need to talk.
QUELL: This matter does not concern the passengers.
DOCTOR: I'm not a passenger. I'm your worst nightmare.
(The Doctor hands Quell his psychic paper.)
QUELL: A mystery shopper. Oh, great.
DOCTOR: Really? That's your worst? Okay, I'm a mystery shopper. I could do with an extra pillow and I'm very disappointed with your breakfast bar and all of the dying.

[Quell's office]

(Quell gets two glasses and pours drinks. On the wall is a framed Certificate of Bravery awarded to Capt. Hector Quell by United Galaxy Tours. The time on the clock is 11:24)
QUELL: This is not exactly within your job description.
DOCTOR: Come on, Captain. Where would we all be if we all followed our job descriptions, hmm? Good question. Glad you asked. In your case, you'd be doing something instead of climbing inside a bottle.
QUELL: I have followed the procedure for accidental death to the letter.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you have. And I'm sure you do just enough of your job to avoid complaints.
QUELL: You don't know anything about me.
DOCTOR: Wounded in battle, honourable discharge. And this is just a guess, but I think you've had the fight knocked out of you. You expected this to be a cushy desk job where you could put your head down until retirement. Well, I'm sorry. As of today, that dream is over.
QUELL: There is no evidence of any attack or other parties
DOCTOR: Yes, let's just sit around and wait for the evidence while the bodies pile up. Or here's a crazy thought. We could do something to stop it. Why am I even talking to you?

[Corridor]

(Perkins is waiting outside with rolls of papers.)
PERKINS: Er, passenger manifest, plan of the train and a list of stops for the past six months.
DOCTOR: Quick work, Perkins. Maybe too quick.
PERKINS: Yes, sir. I'm obviously the mummy. Or perhaps I was already looking into this.

[Strong room]

(Maisie and Clara are sitting on a box or something, their backs against a wall.)
MAISIE: This Doctor. He's your what, exactly?
CLARA: He's not my anything.
MAISIE: Oh, you mean you're just friends.
CLARA: Yeah, Of course we're just friends. Oh. Well, not even friends, not any more.
MAISIE: Well, that clearly isn't true.
CLARA: It's true. It is. It's very true.
MAISIE: You do seem to be here together.
CLARA: Seriously? We're stuck in this carriage, probably all night, and all we can talk about is some man?
MAISIE: Some man?
CLARA: Not that kind of. Look, we, er, we knocked about together, we travelled and now we're stopping. This is a, I don't know, goodbye to the good times?
MAISIE: Were the good times all like this?
(Clara laughs a little.)
CLARA: Yeah. Now that you mention it

[Engineer's room]

(The Doctor is timing the recorded attack on Mrs Pitt, as recorded by CCTV, while Moorhouse and Perkins look on.)
MRS PITT [on screen]: No! No! Get it out! Argh!
DOCTOR: Sixty six seconds. It fits the myth. Did you see the lights flicker?
MOORHOUSE: Mmm.
PERKINS: Yeah, the lights went in the kitchen as well just before the chef saw it.
MOORHOUSE: In all of the accounts, conventional weapons have no effect on the Foretold. It's immortal, unstoppable, unkillable.
PERKINS: Can we get a new expert?
(The train continues on its way, trailing smoke.)

[Strong room]

MAISIE: Oh, he was wrong.
CLARA: Yes. Yes. Yes, he was.
MAISIE: And, and high-handed and, and thoughtless and, and, and arrogant beyond belief.
CLARA: Exactly.
MAISIE: And you got on a train with him.
CLARA: I was saying goodbye. You can't end it on a slammed door.
MAISIE: Yes, you can. Anyone can do it. People do it all the time. Except, of course, when they can't. (sigh) Life would be so much simpler if you liked the right people. People you're supposed to like. But then, I guess there'd be no fairy tales.
(In the Engineer's room, Moorhouse is sleeping in a chair, and Perkins is slumped at his desk. The Doctor is looking through papers when there is a beeping sound and the blinds are raised. It must be morning, train time. He takes the intercom phone off the wall and sonicks it, disconnects its cord from of the wall then calls Clara.)
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR [OC]: Wake up

[Engineer's room]

DOCTOR: Sleepy-head. Time for breakfast. Knowing this train, it'll taste

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Amazing.
CLARA: Doctor, please, I'm in trouble
DOCTOR [OC]: Can't even get that right, huh?
CLARA: Doctor

[Engineer's room]

DOCTOR: Bad food on trains is traditional.

[Strong room]

CLARA: Doctor, please, just li

[Engineer's room]

DOCTOR: Listen, there's been another mummy murder. So our last hurrah

[Strong room]

CLARA: Doc
DOCTOR [OC]: Just became a bit more interesting.
CLARA: I'm trapped!

[Engineer's room]

DOCTOR: What? Where are you?
(Perkins and Moorhouse wake up as the Doctor dashes out.)

[Baggage car]

(The Doctor hammers on the strong room door.)
DOCTOR: Clara!

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Is that you?
CLARA: Yes. Yes. Hello. Can you hear us?

[Baggage car]

(The Doctor tries sonicking the lock and gets a shock.)
DOCTOR: Ow! Computer, can you open the door, please?
GUS: Call me Gus. I'm afraid this door can only be opened by executive order.
DOCTOR: Oh. Forget it.
(The Doctor tries scanning the door with the screwdriver. It stutters then stops.)
DOCTOR: Oh. Now the stupid sonic

[Strong room]

CLARA: What?
DOCTOR [OC]: Screwdriver's not working.
CLARA: What? What do you mean, it's not working? Why?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Some sort of a

[Baggage car]

DOCTOR: Suppression field, I would guess. And it has to be a guess because, as I say, the stupid sonic screwdriver's not working. What are you even

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Doing in there?
CLARA: Well, I was looking for you

[Baggage car]

CLARA [OC]: Mister Nothing To Worry About.
DOCTOR: What, was I supposed to waken you up? Drag you out of bed

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Because I had a hunch? I thought you didn't want to do this any more.
CLARA: Look, look, please, can we just not do this now? I think we might not be alone in here. (sotto) There's a sarcophagus.

[Baggage car]

DOCTOR: Is it in there?

[Strong room]

(The light on the front of the sarcophagus changes from red to green, there is the sound of air escaping and it starts to open.)
CLARA: I think we might just be about to find out. Turns out the sonic is working.

[Baggage car]

CLARA [OC]: Just not on the door we need.
(The lights flicker. The clock at the bottom of the screen starts counting down from 66.)
DOCTOR: Clara, it's coming.
(The Doctor is works frantically on the lock.)

[Strong room]

(Clara walks up to the sarcophagus.)
CLARA: Doctor?
(The sarcophagus lid swings fully open.)
CLARA: Doctor, it's okay. It's er, it's full of bubble wrap.
(With flashing red lights behind it.)

[Baggage car]

DOCTOR: But the lights?
QUELL: Doctor, move away from the door.
(Quell points at the Doctor. Two other armed guards are with him, one pointing a gun.)
DOCTOR: My friend's inside.
QUELL: Then they're in trouble, too. I spoke to Head Office. There is no mystery shopper. You're not even on the passenger list.
DOCTOR: Clara, I'm going to have to call you back.
QUELL: Come on.
(30 seconds. They handcuff the Doctor.)
DOCTOR: You know, I'm going to have to mark you down for this.
QUELL: You are not a mystery shopper. For all I know, you're the one behind the killings.
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Captain. How many people have to die before you stop looking the other way?

[Lounge]

(A guard is shooting at something only he can see.)
GUARD: Get back! Stay back!
(His shots break glasses on tables. Nine seconds.)
QUELL: What do you think you're doing, man?
GUARD: Please, please! Stop! No
QUELL: Get up, man. That's an order!
(The mummy holds the guard's head, then he falls back. The doctor in the white coat and Edward VII beard checks for a pulse and shakes his head. Moorhouse give Quell the guard's gun. He hands it off to another guard.)
QUELL: It turns out it's three. The amount of people that had to die before I stopped looking the other way.
(The Doctor is released.)
DOCTOR: Thank you.
PERKINS: Same as the others?
(He has appeared suddenly and silently at the Doctor's elbow.)
GUARD: Excuse me please. Take his feet. Excuse me please.
(The other guards carry their late colleague away.)
DOCTOR: Ladies and gentlemen, could I have a moment of your time, please? There's a monster on this train that can only be seen by those about to die. If you do see it, you will have exactly sixty six seconds left in which to live. But that isn't even the strangest thing. Do you know what is? You. The passengers. Experts in alien biology, mythology, physics. If I was putting together a team to analyse this thing, I'd pick you. And I think somebody has. Someone of immense power and influence has orchestrated this whole trip. Someone who I have no doubt is listening to us right now. So, are you going to step out from behind the curtain and give us our orders?
PERKINS: The engines. They've stopped.
(In a flurry of electronic activity, the 1920s railway carriage decor is replaced by a high-tech laboratory.)
DOCTOR: And the facade drops away because what use are a bunch of scientists without a lab?
(A large number of people disappear. One of those remaining looks remarkably like Albert Einstein.)
PERKINS: Teleporter?
DOCTOR: No. Hard light holograms. They were never really here. Fake passengers to make up the numbers.
(Hard light? Red Dwarf!)
QUELL: That was my best guard.
(Ting! The thumbs up icon on a monitor is replaced by a monocle.)
GUS: Good morning, everyone. Around the room you will find a variety of scientific equipment. Your goal is to ascertain the Foretold's true nature, probe for weaknesses with a view to capture, after which we will reverse engineer its abilities. Isn't this exciting?
DOCTOR: You said capture, implying that you can't control this thing. And yet somehow you got it on board. How?
GUS: There is an artefact, an ancient scroll. I have highlighted it for your convenience. For reasons currently unknown, the Foretold appears in the vicinity of this artefact.
(A small spotlight turns to illuminate the scroll on the door at the end of the car. It has cuneiform writing on it, which is interesting as that is really marks made in moist clay, not painted on papyrus or fabric.)
DOCTOR: And kills at regular intervals.
QUELL: Then just maybe we should throw this thing out in the airlock.
DOCTOR: No! No! No!
(Quell gets an electric shock when he tries to touch the scroll.)
PERKINS: Looks like they've thought of that.
MOORHOUSE: What if we say no? Down tools. Refuse to work.
GUS: That is your choice, of course. But it would be very upsetting were you all to die at the hands of the Foretold.
PERKINS: So hurry up, before it kills you.
DOCTOR: But even if they agree to this, how are they supposed to study a creature that they can't even see? We don't even know what the species is.
(The light flickers.)
DOCTOR: Perkins, start the clock.
MOORHOUSE: Approximately one point eight metres tall. Actually, seeing it in the flesh isn't nearly as rewarding as I thought it might be.
(The mummy drags its left foot as it approaches.)
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Hard cheese. What can you see? Details.
MOORHOUSE: Yes. Yes, of course, of course. Uh Well, it just looks like er, a man in bandages. I
DOCTOR: What kind of bandages? Old? New?
MOORHOUSE: Old.
DOCTOR: Whole? Ragged?
MOORHOUSE: Ragged. Falling off in places. I don't know what you want me to tell you.
DOCTOR: Listen to me! You can see this thing. We can't. Tell us what you can see. Even the smallest detail might help save the next one.
MOORHOUSE: The next one? You mean you can't save me?
DOCTOR: Well, that is implied, isn't it? Yes, this is probably the end for you. But make it count. Details, please.
MOORHOUSE: Er, flesh. Some of it is visible
PERKINS: Thirty seconds.
MOORHOUSE: Er, leathery. Ancient looking. Peat bog preserved.
DOCTOR: Keep talking. Don't waste this chance.
MOORHOUSE: I want to bargain for my life.
DOCTOR: W-w-w-what?
MOORHOUSE: Well, it says, some of the myths say if you, if you find the right word, if you make the right offer, then it lets you go.
DOCTOR: This is not a myth. This is real. Forget your superstitions. Tell us what you can see.
MOORHOUSE: This is my life, my death. I'm going to fight for it how I want. Er, I give you
PERKINS: Ten seconds.
MOORHOUSE: My soul. I confess all sins. I give you all my worldly goods. Only, please, please, please. No!
(The mummy holds Moorhouse's head, then he falls.)
PERKINS: Zero.
GUS: We apologise for any distress you may have just experienced. Grief counselling is available on request. On the bright side, I'm sure you've all collected a lot of data. Well done, everyone!
PERKINS: It's recording every death.
DOCTOR: Of course it is. That's why we're here. To study our own demise. So let's get to work. Come on. Chop, chop.
(The Doctor hands out white lab coats. Later, the phone rings. The bald man checks his inside pocket.)
DOCTOR: Clara Oswald.

[Strong room]

(Clara and Maisie are going through some papers they have found in a box.)
CLARA: Okay. So, first things first. The sarcophagus is actually a secure stasis unit.

[Laboratory]

(No point in calling it the lounge anymore.)
DOCTOR: Yes. It's where they want us to put the Foretold if we

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Capture it.
CLARA: Well, that would have been good to know.
DOCTOR [OC]: Sorry.

[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Teeny bit busy round here. What else?
GUS: Please terminate your call and return to work.
CLARA [OC]: We have some paperwork. Passenger manifests from

[Strong room]

CLARA: Other ships. Maisie recognised a couple of the names. These are missing ships.
DOCTOR [OC]: So, we're not the first.
CLARA: No.

[Laboratory]

GUS: Please terminate your call and return to work.
CLARA [OC]: I've got some progress reports.

[Strong room]

CLARA: The Gloriana spent three days getting picked off by the Foretold. All died. Performance marked as poor.

[Galley]

GUS: Warning. Decompression imminent. Please vacate the area.
CHEF 2: No!

[Secure room]

CLARA: The Valiant Heart. Forty two crew, four died.

[Laboratory]

CLARA [OC]: Performance, promising.
GUS: Please terminate the call and return to work.
QUELL: I think you should do as it says.
(Because the catering staff and equipment are floating past the window.)
DOCTOR: Clara, I have to go.
GUS: I'm sorry. I know that must have been distressing for you. But if you are disobedient again, I will decompress another area containing less valuable passengers.
DOCTOR: Less valuable passengers? How does it choose?
PERKINS: Well, I'm assuming qualifications
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Not the computer, the Foretold. How does it choose who to kill? We've assumed it's random. What if it's not? I want full histories on all the victims. Medical, social, personal.
GUS: Well done.
DOCTOR: Don't mention it.
(Later, looking at a tablet computer.)
PERKINS: Doesn't seem to be any pattern. Their travel history, interests, health. It's all over the shop. Health?
DOCTOR: Health? Are you sure? Mrs Pitt, the first victim. She was over a hundred years old. The frailest passenger on board.
PERKINS: Oh but the next to go, the chef, was young and fit. It's random.
QUELL: The chef was ill.
DOCTOR: What?
QUELL: A rare blood disorder. Not contagious, but we kept it quiet.
DOCTOR: Because he worked with food. The next one, the guard?
QUELL: He wasn't ill as such, but he did have synthetic lungs implanted last year.
PERKINS: Professor Moorhouse. It seems he was physically fine but suffering from, here we are. Regular panic attacks after a car crash last year.
DOCTOR: It's picking off the weakest first. Sensing the illness somehow. The fake organs, even psychological issues. But this is good news, because it means we can work out who is next. I want the medical records of everybody alive who is still on board. If anyone's had as much as a cold, I want to know about it.
QUELL: You really think it can sense psychological issues?
DOCTOR: It seems so. Why?
QUELL: When you said I'd lost the stomach for a fight, I wasn't wounded in battle as such, but. My unit was bombed. I was the sole survivor. Not a scratch on me. But post-traumatic stress. Nightmares. Still can't sleep without pills.
DOCTOR: Which means that you are probably next. Which is good to know.
QUELL: Well, not for me.
DOCTOR: Well, of course not for you, because you're going to die. But I mean for us, from a research point of view.
QUELL: You know, for a doctor, your bedside manner leaves
(Lights flicker.)
DOCTOR: Well, there's goes our head start. Perkins, start the clock.
(The mummy appears at the far end of the carriage.)
DOCTOR: What can you see?
QUELL: Almost feels out of focus. Gives me a headache just looking at it.
(Quell draws his service weapon.)
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. That didn't work before.
QUELL: What kind of soldier would I be, dying with bullets in my gun?
(Quell shoots a flask.)
PERKINS: Fifty seconds.
QUELL: Someone shut that man up! For the record, it didn't even flinch.
DOCTOR: Where is it now?
QUELL: Approximately twenty feet in front of me and closing.
PERKINS: Forty seconds.
DOCTOR: Am I close?
(We are treated to the view of the mummy's outstretched fingers coming out of the Doctor's eyes before the rest of its bandaged hand passes through his head.)
QUELL: It's passing right through you, like a ghost.
(Perkins is holding out a scanner and reading his tablet.)
PERKINS: It's not a hologram.
DOCTOR: If you move, will it follow?
QUELL: Do you want me to move? Because I can certainly do that.
DOCTOR: Keep looking at it, but back off quick as you like.
QUELL: It's teleported away. It's behind me.
PERKINS: Twenty seconds.
QUELL: I think this is it. Still, suppose it's not a bad way to go. Blood pumping, enemy at the gates and all that. And thank you, Doctor, for waking me up. It's reaching for me. Hands on my head.
PERKINS: Zero.
QUELL: Ah!
DOCTOR: Teleporter. That means tech. Then sixty six seconds to do what? Sixty six seconds. That seems very, very specific. Too specific for organic. So, what, more tech? What? More? A countdown clock? Something charging?
PERKINS: A man just died in front of us. Can we not just have a moment?
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. We can't do that. We can't mourn. People with guns to their heads, they cannot mourn. We do not have time to mourn. Everybody, what takes sixty six seconds to charge up or to change state? Anyone? Am I surrounded by idiots? If only I could see this thing.
PERKINS: Don't even joke about that.
DOCTOR: I'm not joking about it. One minute with me and this thing, it would be over!
PERKINS: You know, Doctor, I can't tell if you're a genius or just incredibly arrogant.
DOCTOR: Well, ah, on a good day, I'm both. Ancient tech. This thing has been around for centuries. How? Tech that keeps it alive. Tech that drains energy from the living. Scanner.
(He takes Perkin's scanner and uses it on Quell's corpse, then throws it back to Perkins.)
DOCTOR: Deep tissue scan. He's been leached of almost all energy on a cellular level. The heart attack is just a, is just a side effect.
PERKINS: Oh, it's not just a mummy, it's a vampire. Metaphorically speaking.
DOCTOR: But why take sixty six seconds to drain us? Why not just pounce?
PERKINS: Phase. Moving energy out of phase. That takes about a minute, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: That's why only the victims can see it. It takes them out of phase so it can drain their energy. You, sir, are a genius! This explains everything! Apart from what it is and how it's doing it. Sorry, I jumped the gun there with the you're a genius, that explains everything remark.
PERKINS: Doctor, I think we know the next victim.
(Perkins hands the Doctor his tablet.)
DOCTOR: Ah, of course. That makes perfect sense.

[Strong room]

(He phones Clara.)
CLARA: (sotto) Look, she's had a bad day. That's all.
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara, it doesn't care.

[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Her bad day, her bereavement, her little breakdown puts her squarely in its cross hairs. She's next.

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: Every simulation we've run confirms it.
CLARA: Okay, but, but we're in here and, if we stay in here, that thing can't
DOCTOR [OC]: This thing can teleport.

[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: We need her here. Even the computer agrees.

[Strong room]

CLARA: Okay, so you can save her? Right?

[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Of course not. Why would you think that? This is another chance

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: To observe it in action.
CLARA: As it kills her.
DOCTOR [OC]: Of course, as it kills her.

[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: If it happens in there, it'll be a waste

[Strong room]

DOCTOR [OC]: So bring her to us.
CLARA: How? How exactly? She's never going to agree to this.

[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. Lie to her. Tell her I can save her. Whatever it takes to get her here.
(Perkins watches closely as the Doctor throws down the phone and walks away.)

[Strong room]

MAISIE: What's he saying?
CLARA: He says. He says he can save you.

[Baggage car]

(The strong room door opens and they walk out.)
MAISIE: I knew he could get us out of there. I told you, he's a good man.
(Clara tries to walk past the door to the corridor, to the Tardis. The air wibbles as it stops her. The strong room door closes with a ting!)
CLARA: Yes. Yes, he is.
MAISIE: And to be honest, I don't know how convinced I am by this trauma sense thing, but if the Doctor says he can help me anyway, I mean, that has to be a good thing, doesn't it, Clara?

[Laboratory]

(Gus opens the door and lets the women in. The Doctor runs to shake Maisie's hand.)
MAISIE: Hello, again. I'm Maisie.
DOCTOR: Good for you.
CLARA: We passed the Tardis on the way here. Thought about getting inside, hiding, pulling the levers and hoping for the best. But we couldn't even get in. There was a forcefield around it.
(The Doctor uses Perkins' scanner on Maisie.)
DOCTOR: It's probably Gus trying to block our escape route.
CLARA: But how does he even know what it is? Cos if he knows what it is, then he knows what you are.
DOCTOR: Well, he has tried to entice me here before. Free tickets, mysterious summons, he even phoned the Tardis number. Do you know how difficult a number
CLARA: You knew. You knew this was no relaxing break. You knew this was dangerous.
DOCTOR: I didn't know. I certainly hoped.
CLARA: Okay, this. You see, this. This is why I'm leaving you. This. Because you lied. You lied to me, again. And now you've made me lie. You've made me your accomplice.
MAISIE: What? Sorry? When did you lie? Clara?
CLARA: Maisie, I am, I am so sorry.
(Maisie points at the mummy as the lights flicker.)
PERKINS: Do we start the clock?
DOCTOR: Not yet.
(The Doctor stands in front of Maisie and flashes the scanner in her face.)
DOCTOR: Focus. Focus. Focus! All of that is your grief, your trauma, your resentment. And now
(He puts the scanner to his own head and zaps himself.)
DOCTOR: It's mine.
(The mummy growls and vanishes.)
MAISIE: It's gone.
DOCTOR: No. No, it's not. Not for me. Cos now it thinks I'm you.
(He throws the scanner onto a table.)
DOCTOR: Start the clock. (to the mummy) Hello.
(It reaches for him.)
DOCTOR: I'm so pleased to finally see you. I'm the Doctor and I will be your victim this evening. Are you my mummy? But you can't hurt me until my time is up. I think. So are there magic words? Is there a way to stop you in your tracks? Oh, you really didn't like your gran, did you? There's something visible under the bandages. By the way, you weren't being paranoid. She really did poison your pony.
MAISIE: Oh!
DOCTOR: Markings like the ones the scroll. Oh, and your father. Sorry.
MAISIE: What
DOCTOR: A tattered piece of cloth attached to a length of wood that you will kill for.
PERKINS: Thirty seconds.
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound like a scroll. That sounds like a flag! And if that sounds like a flag, if this is a flag, that means that you are a soldier, wounded in a forgotten war thousands of years ago. But they've worked on you, haven't they, son? They've filled you full of kit. State of the art phase camouflage, personal teleporter.
PERKINS: Ten seconds.
DOCTOR: And all that tech inside you, it just won't let you die, will it? It won't let the war end. It just won't let you stop until the war is over. We surrender.
PERKINS: Zero.
MAISIE: (gasps) I can see it again.
(The mummy steps back from the Doctor and lowers its arms.)
CLARA: It's okay. I think we all can.
PERKINS: Do I start the clock?
DOCTOR: No.
(The mummy salutes the Doctor.)
DOCTOR: The clock has stopped. You're relieved, soldier.
(The mummy disintegrates into a pile of dust and old bandages.)
PERKINS: Phew. He's not the only one.
(The Doctor picks up a piece of blue tech with wires from the remains.)
CLARA: We were fighting that?
DOCTOR: So was he.
CLARA: Listen, what I said
DOCTOR: Save it. We're not out of the woods yet. Well, Gus, I think we solved your little puzzle. Ancient soldier being driven by malfunctioning tech.
GUS: Thank you so much for your efforts. They are greatly appreciated. Unfortunately, survivors of this exercise are not required.
(The Doctor has sonicked the tech, and now gets another tool from a different table.)
DOCTOR: Ah, well, there's a shocker.
(People clutch their throats, gasping.)
GUS: Air will now be removed from the entire train. We hope you have enjoyed your journey on the Orient Express.
CLARA: I take it you know a way out?
DOCTOR: My enemy's enemy is my friend. Especially when he has a built in teleporter.
(Perkins and Maisie pass out.)
CLARA: Great! So use it!
DOCTOR: A little more work.
CLARA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Couple of minutes. Max. I'll give you a shout.
(Clara hits the floor with an unlady-like thud. The Orient Express explodes.)

[Pebble beach]

(Clara wakes up wrapped in a blanket and lying on another plaid one. The Doctor is back in his dark blue suit sans tie and is scratching at the little visible sand with a stick, doing his Gallefreyan maths. The sky is pink.)
DOCTOR: Oh hello, again. Sleep well?
CLARA: Weren't we just on a train?
DOCTOR: Oh, that was ages ago.
CLARA: And?
DOCTOR: And what? Oh, and we got off the train. Oh, well, the teleporter worked eventually. Beamed everyone into the Tardis. No casualties, just a bevy of sleeping beauties. I tried hacking Gus from the Tardis, find out who set this all up. He really didn't like that. Set off some fail-safe thing. Blew up the train.
CLARA: Blew up the train?
DOCTOR: Blew up the train. But we got away. Then I dropped everyone off at the nearest civilised planet, which happened to be here.
(View of a city with tall pointed buildings in the background.)
DOCTOR: You seemed happy asleep so I just left you.
CLARA: So you saved everyone.
DOCTOR: No, I just saved you and I let everyone else suffocate. Ha, ha, ha.
CLARA: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Yeah, this is just my cover story.
CLARA: So, when you lied to Maisie, when you made me lie to Maisie
DOCTOR: I couldn't risk Gus finding out my plan and stopping me.
CLARA: So you were pretending to be heartless.
DOCTOR: Would you like to think that about me? Would that make it easier? I didn't know if I could save her. I couldn't save Quell, I couldn't save Moorhouse. There was a good chance that she'd die too. At which point, I would have just moved onto the next, and the next, until I beat it. Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones. But you still have to choose.

[Tardis]

(Perkins is looking at the workings under the time rotor.)
PERKINS: Er, it's er, quite a vehicle you have here, Doctor. I won't pretend to understand half of it. Having said that, I did notice you've got a couple of drive stacks need replacing.
DOCTOR: Oh, you did, did you?
PERKINS: Yeah. You should get someone in. And a job like that takes forever.
DOCTOR: Really? Well, I suppose, whoever I did get in, it might just be easier to have them stay on board for a while. I don't suppose you'd know of anyone?
PERKINS: No. Sorry, Doctor, but I don't think I do. That job could er, change a man.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Frequently.
(They go back up to the main deck where Clara is walking around with her mobile phone in hand, still in her 1920s costume.)
DOCTOR: Well, I won't keep you. Goodbye, Perkins. Good to meet you.
PERKINS: You too, Doctor. And er, good luck.
(They shake. Perkins touches his cap to Clara on his way out.)
CLARA: Do you love it?
DOCTOR: Love what?
CLARA: I know it's scary and difficult, but do you love being the man making the impossible choice?
DOCTOR: Why would I?
CLARA: Because it's what you do, all day, every day.
DOCTOR: It's my life.
CLARA: Doesn't have to be. Is it like
DOCTOR: Like what?
CLARA: An addiction?
DOCTOR: You can't really tell if something's an addiction till you try and give it up.
CLARA: And you never have.
DOCTOR: Let me know how it goes.
(Clara's phone rings. She goes up to the gallery to answer it.)
CLARA: Hey, Danny. How are you?
DANNY [OC]: Fine.

[Danny's flat]

DANNY: So, is it done?

[Tardis]

CLARA: Yep. Mission accomplished. Listen, I can't talk now but I'll see you soon and, er, I love you.
DANNY [OC]: I love you, too.
CLARA: Huh. No accounting for taste.
DANNY [OC]: Okay, see you soon.
DOCTOR: Was that Danny? What did he want?
CLARA: (deep breath, then) He's fine with it.
DOCTOR: Sorry, I
CLARA: Danny. He's fine with the idea of me and you knocking about. It was his idea that we stop but, he's decided he doesn't mind and neither do I. Oh, to hell with the last hurrah. Let's keep going.
DOCTOR: That's a big change of heart.
CLARA: Yeah, they happen.
DOCTOR: Seriously?
CLARA: Look, as long as you get me home safe and on time, everything is great. I am so sorry. I've had a wobble. It's a big wobble, but it's fine. Forget about it. Now, shut up and give me some planets.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad that you said that, because you know that one that's made entirely of shrubs. Are you sure about this?
CLARA: Are you? Have you ever been sure?
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: Then what are you waiting for? Let's go.
(They pull the levers together, and the Tardis flies.)


(Transcriber's note - this is a version with intercutting scenes merged to make them flow more smoothly, like I did when the teenagers were talking on their mobile phones in the Sarah Jane Adventures.)
[Flat]

(A frightened bearded man is making a telephone call.)
ROSCOE: Police, please. Hello? Yes. I know who did it. Who did it all. I figured it out. No. No, I can't speak up. They might hear me.
(Something hisses or sizzles nearby.)
ROSCOE: Oh, no. Oh, no. Listen. Listen. They are everywhere. All around. We've been so blind. Argh!
(In a flash he is pulled downwards and disappears, and the telephone dangles on its cord from the wall.)
OPERATOR [on phone]: Hello? Sir? Are you in a safe place? Are you being held against your will? Sir?
(Our attention is brought to a image of an elongated screaming bearded man forming on the narrow wall paper border running across the middle of the wall.)

[Tardis]

(Clara comes up the stairs to the console room.)
DOCTOR: You could leave all that stuff here, you know. We do have literally acres of room.
CLARA: Oh, no. It's all right. Danny's got a little bit territorial. The idea of me leaving so much as a toothbrush here. But, still, he's all right with us doing this which I admit's a little bit weird, cos you'd think if he had a problem with me leaving stuff in the Tardis, he'd object to me travelling in the Tardis. But he's not, so.
DOCTOR: Sorry. Stopped listening a while ago. Okay. Er, same time you left, same place-ish.
CLARA: Ish? Don't give me an ish.
DOCTOR: These readings are very er, ishy.
CLARA: Er, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Uh huh?
(He goes to join her looking at the Tardis door, which is now about a metre high. The Doctor stoops to open it and look outside.)

[Waste ground]

(The sound of a train travelling along a track nearly. Doctor struggles to squeeze out through the gap. Clara follows him and closes the door. Why didn't they open both doors? There are tracks and a train shed behind them. A sign on the railings says Bristol Sidings 344.)
DOCTOR: Well. Well, I wonder what caused this? I don't think we're bigger, are we?
(He scans Clara.)
CLARA: Bristol? Doctor, we're in Bristol!
DOCTOR: And a hundred and twenty miles from where we should be. Impressive.
CLARA: No. Not impressive. Annoying.
DOCTOR: No. This is impressive.
(He points at Clara.)
DOCTOR: This is annoying. The Tardis never does this. This is huge! Well, not literally huge. Slightly smaller than usual. Which is huge.
CLARA: Yes. I get it. You're excited. When can I go home?
DOCTOR: Your house isn't going anywhere. And neither is mine until I get this figured out. Could you not just let me enjoy this moment of not knowing something? I mean, it happens so rarely. Look, I don't think this is dangerous, but I wouldn't like you to get squished accidentally. Anyway, I need you to help me find out what's caused this.
CLARA: Fine. I'll go take a look around.
(Clara walks away past the train shed whilst the Doctor squeezes back in through the Tardis door.)

[Shopping precinct]

(A older man wearing an ID badge goes up to a younger black man in a yellow luminous waistcoat, standing in front of a wall full of graffiti tags. There are other men there. All have numbers on their shirt collars.)
FENTON: It's your filth, Rigsy, start with your signature.
(Fenton puts a brush into a tin on white paint. A bald man with number 36 on his collar speaks up for the young man.)
AL: Oh, come on, there's no need for this.
(Rigsy, number 52, takes the brush.)
FENTON: There you go.
(Rigsy starts to paint over his tag.)
FENTON: Get on with it. This is community service, not a holiday camp.

[Tardis]

(The Doctor is closely examining a Tardis circuit when there is a jolt and an an alarm sounds.)
DOCTOR: Now, that wasn't me, was it?
(He goes to the door and looks at it.)
DOCTOR: Oh, that can't be good.

[Subway]

(Clara goes down towards an underpass. There is a shrine of pictures and flowers by the steps. The community payback group are near the top of the steps. Convict 55 calls out to her. I'm guessing his name from the cast list.)
STAN: Cheer up, love. Might never happen.
GEORGE: (No. 22, an Indian man) Have some respect. She's grieving.
STAN: Oh, sorry, love. I didn't mean nothing by it.
(Clara walks on, and Rigsy runs after her. The underpass proper is decorated with Banksy-style images of people with their backs to us, men and women including one with a child.)
RIGSY: Sorry about them. They're idiots.
CLARA: That's all right, don't worry. I've heard worse.
RIGSY: I've lost someone, too. My Aunt Karina. Deaf as a post. Didn't really know her that well but she's still gone. Is your one in the mural?
(He strokes the back of a small woman in a yellow jacket.)
CLARA: Oh, no. I haven't actually
RIGSY: I'm sure they'll get round to it at some point. I'm not really with that lot out there. I just have to do this community service thing. I just do graffiti. Not anything, you know, murdery or CLARA: So, er, what's all this about? What's happened to all these people?
RIGSY: You mean you don't know?

[Tardis]

CLARA [OC]: Hey, I think I've found something. People are missing all over the estate.

[Waste ground]

(Clara is reporting in via mobile phone.)
CLARA: Do you think there's a connection?
DOCTOR [OC]: Could be.
CLARA: And where are you?
DOCTOR: [OC]: Exactly where I was.
CLARA: No, you're not. I'm here and I can't see. Oh.
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes. Oh.
(The Tardis is maybe six inches high. Clara laughs.)
CLARA: Oh, my God, that is so adorable. Are you in there?
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, I am.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: And, no, it's not adorable. It's very, very serious.
(The Doctor takes a small item from a wooden box.)
CLARA [OC]: So is this more shrink ray stuff? Are you tiny in there?
DOCTOR: No. I'm exactly the same size. It's merely the exterior dimensions that have changed.
(The door is a tiny thing in the middle of a wall. He opens it.)

[Waste ground]

(We can see most of the Doctor's face through the open double doors.)
DOCTOR: Stop laughing. This is serious.
CLARA: Yeah, well, I can't help it, can I, with you and your big old face. How are you going to get out?
DOCTOR: Well, plainly I can't. Something nearby is leeching all the external dimensions.
CLARA: Aliens?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Oh, who am I kidding? Probably. Sensors are down and I can't risk taking off with it in this state. Clara, I need you to pick up the Tardis. Carefully. It should be possible. I've adjusted the relative gravity.
(She does.)

[Tardis]

CLARA [OC]: You mean you've made it lighter.
DOCTOR: Clara, it's always lighter. If the Tardis were to land with its true weight, it would fracture the surface of the Earth.
CLARA [OC]: Yeah, maybe a story for another time. What now?
DOCTOR: I've managed to get a rough fix on the source of the dimensional leeching.

[Waste ground / Tardis]

(The Doctor's fingers poke out of the door.)
DOCTOR: It's roughly north west. That way.
CLARA: Please don't do that. That's just wrong.
(He runs back to the console to get some objects.)
DOCTOR: Now, listen! You're going to need these.
(He hands out the psychic paper.)
CLARA: Oh, wow. This is an honour. Does this mean I'm you now?
DOCTOR: No, it does not, so don't get any ideas.
(And the sonic screwdriver. She puts the Tardis in her shoulder bag. He then hands up the tiny object from the box)
DOCTOR: And listen, stick this in your ear. Can you hear me?
CLARA: Yes. Ow! What just happened?
DOCTOR: Nanotech. I just hacked your optic nerve.
CLARA: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: I see what you see.

[Shopping precinct / Tardis]

(Clara turns around, pointing the screwdriver at a block of flats then a wall with a mural of footprints, hand prints and tyre marks.)
CLARA: Anything?
(The view is on the scanner.)
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm dizzy. But nothing useful.
RIGSY [on scanner]: You never did tell me your name.
DOCTOR: No time to fraternize. Come on, get rid of him.
CLARA: I'm er
(The community payback workers are on a meal break.)
CLARA: I'm the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Don't you dare.
CLARA: Doctor Oswald. But you can call me Clara.
RIGSY: I'm Rigsy. So er, what are you a doctor of?
DOCTOR: Of lies.
CLARA: Well, I'm usually quite vague about that. I think I just picked the title because it makes me sound important.
DOCTOR: Why, Doctor Oswald, you are hilarious. Could we get back to work, do you think?
RIGSY: What are you exactly? You don't smell like police but that's some pretty cool gear you got there. You like a spy, or something?
DOCTOR: Oh, he's a bright one, hang on to him.

[Flat]

RIGSY: He was the last one to go missing.
(Rigsy breaks the Police tape across the front door.)
RIGSY: And when he disappeared all the doors and windows were locked from the inside.
DOCTOR [OC]: Ooh, now you're talking. I love a good locked room mystery.
(On the wall behind behind a bookcase of CDs is an interesting mural of what looks like a cracked sandy surface.)
CLARA: Yeah, doesn't everyone?
RIGSY: What?
CLARA: Huh? Oh, sorry. I'm talking to somebody else. He's listening in. Doctor, Rigsy, Rigsy, the Doctor.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Hello, barely sentient local.
RIGSY [on scanner]: Another Doctor?
DOCTOR: How do you sleep at night?

[Flat / Tardis]

DOCTOR: Missing people, tiny Tardis, what's the link?
(Clara scans with the screwdriver.)
RIGSY: I think this is great that someone's finally looking into this. The police weren't doing anything. They never do on this estate. People were thinking that no one was listening. That no one cared. So, yeah. I think it's great what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Clara, look, I think that we can manage on our own from now on.
CLARA: Yeah, well, I think he could still be useful.
DOCTOR: He's a pudding brain. Worse than that, he's a fluorescent pudding brain.
CLARA: Okay, fine. And all those other missing people, I suppose you know where they lived.
RIGSY: He could still be in the room.
CLARA: Sorry, what?
RIGSY: Sorry, nothing. I was just thinking out loud. It's like one of those locked room things you get in books.
(Clara looks at herself in the oval mirror over the mantelpiece.)
RIGSY: It's always something weird, like, he's still in the room or something. Do you want to go and check out another flat?
DOCTOR: Do you know, I think that you were wrong about this lad. I think that he could be very useful. Vital local knowledge.
CLARA [on scanner]: Oh, really?
DOCTOR: Yes. So try not to scare him off.
CLARA [on scanner]: How would I scare him off?
(Clara carries on scanning. Rigsy looks at that mural.)
RIGSY: Maybe he's lost in the desert, or something.
CLARA: Okay, right. Are we missing something here? Missing man, locked room.
(The scanner image zooms in on the mural.)
CLARA: Shrink ray?
RIGSY: Sorry, did you say just say shrink ray?
CLARA: What if he is still in this room like you said, only tiny? You know, like underneath the sofa or something.
DOCTOR: Clara, this is the scaring off that we were talking about.
RIGSY: Okay. So er, my lunch break's nearly up. This this has been er, interesting.
DOCTOR: Clara, local knowledge is leaving. Do something!
CLARA: Rigsy! One sec. Doctor, open the doors.
DOCTOR: I didn't mean that!
CLARA: Look, you want him to stay or not?
DOCTOR: You really do throw your companions in at the deep end, don't you?
(Clara puts the Tardis on a shelf.)
CLARA: Rigsy, come here. Meet the Doctor.
(The Doctor is visible through the Tardis doorway, but standing back from it, so not as way out of proportion as earlier.)
CLARA: So, what do you think? Tiny man idea.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a lovely thought. Which is why I set the sonic to scan for that as soon as we entered. Pleased to meet you.
CLARA: And you didn't think to tell me?
DOCTOR: Well, of course he might have been squashed under a policeman's shoe by now.
RIGSY: It's bigger. On the inside.
DOCTOR: Do you know, I don't think that statement's ever been truer.
RIGSY: What are you? Like, aliens, or something?
CLARA: No. Well, he is.
(Sizzle! An alarm sounds in the Tardis.)
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor, did you hear that?
DOCTOR: Yes. Whatever it was, it just drained a massive amount of energy from inside the Tardis.
CLARA: What was it?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but that's the least of my problems. Just get us out of here.
(He slams the door shut.)
CLARA: Okay. Go. Rigsy, this is where we run. Stick with me.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: I mean this is just embarrassing. I'm from the race that built the Tardis. Dimensions are kind of our thing. So why can't I understand this?

[Street]

DOCTOR [OC]: Clara, I need more info. Where else have people disappeared?

[Mr Heath's home / Tardis]

(A policewoman is looking at the psychic paper.)
FORREST: MI5?
CLARA: Yes, this case has got our attention.
FORREST: Well, you've come to the right place, ma'am. First reported disappearance, a Mister Heath. It's not on the estate, but it's exactly the same MO as the rest
DOCTOR: Clara, I think that your shrink ray theory was wrong.
CLARA: My shrink ray theory? I thought you were already scanning for that.
FORREST: It's like they vanished.
CLARA: Doctor? What are you doing?
DOCTOR: It just struck me. Locked room mysteries. Classic solution number one, they're still in the room. Classic solution number two, they're in the walls.
CLARA: What do you mean, they're in the
(Clara pulls a lump hammer from her bag, supplied by the Doctor from his workbench.)
FORREST: Have we done as much as we could? No. Do we have any suspects? No. Off the record, I think the top brass are hoping if they ignore this it'll all just go away.
CLARA: Apparently they're in the walls.
(Rigsy slams the hammer into the plaster work then hands it to Clara. PC Forrest's phone rings.)
FORREST: PC Forrest. Yes, sir. MI5, sir.
(She goes out to continue the conversation.)
RIGSY: So, you and that bloke in a box. You do this sort of stuff a lot?
CLARA: Oh, well, he's usually out of the box. But, yep.

[Mr Heath's front room]

FORREST: I don't know. Maybe they thought we weren't doing enough, sir.
(The wall wibbles behind her. She turns.)
FORREST: Can I call you back?
(She uses her torch on the 60s decor.)

[Mr Heath's home]

RIGSY: So how'd you get this gig? You study science, or aliens, or something?
CLARA: (laughs) No. Well, it's kind of a more of a right place, right time or wrong place, wrong time depending on how he's behaving.
DOCTOR [OC]: I can hear you, you know.

[Mr Heath's front room / Tardis]

(The carpet wibbles towards Forrest's feet.)
FORREST: Ma'am, there's something in here, I think.
(She screams as her leg is pulled into the carpet. Rigsy and Clara get there just after she disappears.)
CLARA: PC Forrest? Hello? Hello?
(The torch is lying on the carpet and there is a new mural on the wall behind the sofa. A design of almost completely bilaterally symmetrical red lines.)
CLARA: Doctor, she's gone.
DOCTOR: What am I missing? The Tardis should be able to detect anything in the known universe. The known universe. This universe.
(The scanner shows what Clara can see looking around the room.)
DOCTOR: Clara, wait, go back. Back, back, back. That mural. That is a nervous system scaled up and flattened. I think we've found PC Forrest. What's left of her, at least.
CLARA: Her nervous system.
(The Doctor calls up previous images on the scanner.)
DOCTOR: The mural in the flat. That wasn't a desert at all. It's a microscopic blow up of human skin.
CLARA: What? Why?
DOCTOR: Whatever they are, they are experimenting. They're testing. They are, they are dissecting. Trying to understand us. Trying to understand three dimensions.
(There is the sizzling or hissing sound, then the door slams shut. Rigsy reaches for the handle, but cannot take hold of it.)
RIGSY: Ow. The handle.
CLARA: Doctor. The handle, they've flattened the handle.
DOCTOR: Fascinating. Clara, they're in the walls! Keep away from them. If they touch you, you're finished.
(The sofa and cushions lose their third dimension.)
RIGSY: What happens if they touch us?
(Then an comfy chair goes.)
CLARA: I really don't want to find out.
(They climb onto a handy hanging seat.)
RIGSY: They can't jump, can they?
(Clara's mobile phone rings.)
CLARA: Hey, you.

[Park]

DANNY: I've got our bench. Did you get held up?

[Mr Heath's front room]

CLARA: Just a little. Sorry, Danny. I think lunch is er, a bust.
(The enemy is making the carpet wibble as it moves towards them.)
DANNY [OC]: Oh, hon, you're missing

[Park]

DANNY: Some classic park action.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Clara, the window!

[Mr Heath's front room]

(The fireplace then mantelpiece wibble. In fact, the wibble is coming at them from all directions, except down.)
RIGSY: Look! Look! They're climbing the walls.
DANNY [OC]: Who was that?
CLARA: Er, that's just a guy on community support and I'm helping him find his auntie.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Nice. Not technically lying.

[Park]

DANNY: Sounds kind of active.

[Mr Heath's front room]

(Clara is swinging the seat on its chain towards the bay window, as the wibble heads across the ceiling.)
CLARA: Er, yeah, there was a thing, er a thing.

[Park]

DANNY: Where are you and are you in trouble?

[Mr Heath's front room]

CLARA: No, no, no, I'm fine!
(Clara sonicks the window and the chain comes away from the ceiling. Crash!)

[Park]

DANNY: Clara?
(Sounds of screams.)
DANNY: Clara?

[Mr Heath's front garden]

(A car alarm is sounding. Rigsy and Clara are safe amongst the shattered windows.)
CLARA: Danny?
DANNY [OC]: What's happening?
CLARA: Oh, not much, just some nonsense. Long story.
DANNY [OC]: What story?
CLARA: Tell you later. Love you!

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: This explains everything. They're from a universe with only two dimensions. And, yes, that is a thing. It's long been theorised, of course, but no one could go there and prove its existence without a heck of a diet.
(See Flatland, by Edwin Abbott Abbott, written 1884 and available at Project Gutenberg.)
DOCTOR: And what long story are you going to tell Danny, huh? Or haven't you made it up yet?
CLARA [OC]: Sorry, what? What was that?

[Subway / Tardis]

DOCTOR: Excellent lying, Doctor Oswald.
CLARA: Yeah? Well, thought it was pretty weak myself.
DOCTOR: I meant to me. You told me that Danny was okay with you being back on board the Tardis.
CLARA: Well, he is.
DOCTOR: Yeah, because he doesn't know anything about it.
CLARA: Doctor
DOCTOR: Congratulations. Lying is a vital survival skill.
CLARA: Well, there you go.
DOCTOR: And a terrible habit.
(Clara gets static in her earbud.)
CLARA: Ah. Doctor, you're breaking up a bit.
DOCTOR]: Yeah, of course I am.
CLARA: No, really, you are. I can't hear you.
DOCTOR: What? Oh, right, blowing out that window's possibly affected the earpiece. Take it out and sonic it.
CLARA: Doing it.
(Rigsy goes around the corner to see his work group painting over the mural.)
RIGSY: Hey! They can't do that. Hey! What you doing?
FENTON: Our job. You're on report, by the way. Late back from lunch.
CLARA: Does it even still count as lying if you're doing for someone's own good? Well, like, technically their own good.
RIGSY: It's a memorial!
FENTON [on scanner]: Council didn't approve it, it's graffiti. Stan.
(Rigsy grabs the paint brush.)
DOCTOR: Look, Clara. Talk to me, talk to me!
RIGSY: What are you doing?
(The Doctor's fingers stick out of Clara's bag and jog her elbow.)
DOCTOR: Clara, the mural. Clara, it's the mural! Over there, look, the mural! We've found the missing people, they're in the walls!
(Clara puts her ear bud back in.)
CLARA: What do I do?
DOCTOR: Act normal, but get everyone out.
CLARA: They're very realistic. Who painted them?
RIGSY: I don't know. A local artist. Probably a grieving relative.
CLARA: Did you ever meet them? Or did they just appear after people disappeared?
FENTON: And who are you when you're at home, love?
(Clara brandishes the psychic paper.)
CLARA: Health and safety. This subway is unsafe. Everyone needs to leave right now.
FENTON: This is blank. Try again, sweetheart.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: What? It takes quite a lack of imagination to beat psychic paper.
FENTON: Stan. Do your job.
DOCTOR: Clara, stop him.
(Stan's brush touches the wall and he is sucked in with a cry.)
RIGSY: Stan!
(The images on the wall turn around to face them.)
AL: What is this? What are they?
DOCTOR: They're wearing the dead like camouflage.
CLARA: Forget Stan. Your friend's gone.
DOCTOR: Clara, get them out of there!
CLARA: We need to move. Now.
(They run as the paintings slide off the wall and move across the tarmac.)

[Train shed / Tardis]

(The team run into the nearby train shed across the tracks from the waste ground, and close the corrugated iron door. Clara uses the sonic screwdriver to scan the inside of the building.) GEORGE: Did they follow us? Cos I didn't see them follow us. Are we safe?
AL: Are we really hiding from killer graffiti? This is insane.
DOCTOR: I agree. We'll have to think of a better name for them than that.
GEORGE: And Stan was one of them. Flattened, dead, but coming after us.
DOCTOR: Clara, this is a vital stage. This little group is currently confused and disorientated, but pretty soon a leader is going to emerge. You need to make sure that leader is you.
CLARA: I'm on it. George. George, isn't it? Can you watch that area? If you hear anything, anything moves, you shout, okay?
FENTON: He will do no such thing until I get some answers. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Impersonating a government official. Trespassing on council property.
CLARA: Seriously?
FENTON: Seriously.
CLARA: Fine, I'll tell you who I am. I am the one chance you've got of staying alive. That's who I am.
DOCTOR: Well done.
(The work group go to Clara.)
CLARA: Rigsy, how well do you know this area? Do you know where that door leads?
RIGSY: It's the old Brunswick line. But it's not safe.
AL: Well, there's safe and there's safe.
RIGSY: Yeah, I know it. I used to go down there all the time.
FENTON: Yeah, I'll bet you did. Painting your filth.
CLARA: Yeah, well, you might be glad he did. Those things come in here, that is our only way out. (sotto) I just hope I can keep them all alive.
DOCTOR: Ah, welcome to my world. So what's next, Doctor Clara?
CLARA: Lie to them.
DOCTOR: What?
CLARA: Lie to them. Give them hope. Tell them they're all going to be fine. Isn't that what you would do?
DOCTOR: In a manner of speaking. It's true that people with hope tend to run faster, whereas people who think they're doomed
CLARA: Dawdle. End up dead.
DOCTOR: So that's what I sound like.
FENTON: Who's she talking to?
AL: He says it's MI5.
DOCTOR: Right, here's something that might help you. Do you remember the graffiti from the estate? Footprints, tyre treads?
CLARA: Vaguely.
DOCTOR: Well, I don't think it was graffiti. I think that that is how those creatures saw us. The impressions we make in two dimensional space. That was them reaching out, attempting to talk. At which point they moved into flattening and dissection. Trying to understand. Trying to emulate. But here's the big question. Do they know they're hurting us?
CLARA: So what? You think this is all one big misunderstanding?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Why don't we ask them?
(So while George keeps watch, Rigsy gets a step ladder for Clara to go up to sonick the tannoy speakers.)
DOCTOR: We need to find a way to communicate.
CLARA: Why can't the Tardis just translate?
DOCTOR: Because their idea of language is just as bizarre as their idea of space. Even the Tardis is confused.
FENTON: This is a bad idea. What makes this colleague of yours think those monsters even want to talk?
DOCTOR: I know a race
(The Doctor is searching the Tardis for something.)
DOCTOR: Made of sentient gas who throw fireballs as a friendly wave. I know another race with sixty four stomachs who talk to each other by disembowelling.
CLARA: He's got a hunch.
DOCTOR: My point being that in a universe as immense and bizarre as this one, you cannot be too quick to judge. Perhaps these creatures don't even understand that we need three dimensions to live in.
(He reaches underneath the console.)
DOCTOR: They may not even know that they're hurting us.
CLARA: Do you really believe that?
DOCTOR: No. I really hope that. It would make a nice change, wouldn't it? Okay. Let's start with pi. Even in a flat world they would have circles. I don't mean edible pie, I mean circular pi. Which I realise would also mean edible pie but anyway.
(He types on the console, then the screwdriver flickers and sounds come out of the speakers.)
DOCTOR: They're responding. The Tardis is translating now. It's a number. Fifty five.
CLARA: Fifty five? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Tenth Fibonacci number. Atomic number of caesium.
RIGSY: I know what it means. We all have numbers on our jackets. Have to sign them out. That was the number on Stan's jacket, the man they flattened in the subway.
FENTON: They're gloating.
DOCTOR: We don't know that.
CLARA: It could be an apology, for all we know?
AL: Really? That's nice of them.
FENTON: An apology? Are you seriously
(More sounds.)
CLARA: Shush, shush, shush. Listen. Wait.
DOCTOR: Two two. Twenty two.
CLARA: Twenty two.
RIGSY: That's George.
FENTON: Looks like your number's up, George. Now they're threatening.
CLARA: Maybe. Or maybe they're showing us they can read.
FENTON: Oh, grow up. They're picking targets.
RIGSY: Of course you'd see it that way.
FENTON: What do you mean by that?
CLARA: George?
(George is standing very still.)
RIGSY: Everyone's out to get you, aren't they?
FENTON: In this case, they kind of are.
DOCTOR: Clara, be careful.
(Clara steps to one side whilst looking at George, and sees that he is just a two dimensional image. Then that dissolves into the wall and floor.)
CLARA: The tunnel! Doctor, they've got George.
DOCTOR: I know. I did see.
CLARA: What now?
DOCTOR: Give me a minute. I'm working on it.
(The Doctor is at his workbench, building a gizmo.)

[Disused tunnel / Tardis]

(At a steel door with a wheel in the middle. You know this tunnel is disused because the railway tracks have been removed.)
CLARA: Another flat handle. They were here. Not now. They've stopped chasing us, I think. It feels like they're cornering us.
DOCTOR: You can't apply human logic. You're dealing with creatures from another dimension.
AL: That's three exits all blocked by those creatures.
CLARA: Rigsy, where's the next exit?
RIGSY: The only other one I can think of is where the old line joins the new, but it's a fair walk. Getting through that door would be quicker.
FENTON: But we can't, can we?
RIGSY: I'm just saying.
DOCTOR: Clara, I might be able to help with that door. Give me five minutes.
(The hand sized gizmo is taking shape.)
(Further on, they come across a painting of something exploding out in a circle.)
RIGSY: It's one of mine. Do you like it?
CLARA: Yeah, not bad. So this thing you're working on?
DOCTOR: I think I've figured out a way to restore three dimensions. At least on a small scale, say door handles.
CLARA: So, what's that, then? A de-flattener?
DOCTOR: We're not calling it a de-flattener.
(The Doctor hands it out of her bag. Basically a very old calculator with a ball on top and an extra aerial.)
DOCTOR: This should be able to restore dimensions. You see what I've called it?
CLARA: Two D is. Two Dee Iz?
DOCTOR: No. Twodis. It's called the Twodis. (sigh) Why'd I even bother? Well, give it a go, then.
(Clara aims it at the flat wheel on the steel door. Green rays pulse out of the ball like smoke rings, then there is real smoke and a small bang.)
CLARA: Long way round it is.
(An alarm sounds in the Tardis.)
DOCTOR: Clara, I don't know how, but they're doing it again. They're leeching the Tardis!
CLARA: How? Your doors are closed.
DOCTOR: They've changed frequency. This time it's different.
CLARA: Listen! The Doctor thinks we might be in trouble. He thinks they might be close.
FENTON: Where, exactly?
CLARA: I don't know. He's not sure. He's getting readings all around.
(Something forms a shadow in the light coming down the tunnel.)
FENTON: Oh, that's just great. Sounds important but means absolutely nothing. Can you tell your friend
(A giant hand rushes down the tunnel and grabs Al, lifting him up into the air and taking him back from whence it came. Naturally, he screams.)
AL: Aaaargh! Aaaaaaaaargh!
DOCTOR: Of course. The next stage. 3D.
(Lumps appear in the tunnel floor, which then try to resolve themselves into PC Forrest and others as they rise up.)
RIGSY: Run!
CLARA: Doctor? The door. The handle's flattened.
(The Twodis is handed out of Clara's bag again.)
DOCTOR: I've boosted the output.
CLARA: And it will work this time?
DOCTOR: Absolutely.
(This time there is a steady stream of green smoke rings, and the wheel becomes three dimensional again. Rigsy opens it, they go through and lock it.)
DOCTOR: Clara, stop. Use it again. It can reverse the process.
RIGSY: There's a ladder at the end of this. If we get down into the tunnel, we can make it into daylight.
CLARA: Hang on! Hang on.
(Clara Twodises the wheel into two dimensions again.)
FENTON: If it's flat, we're safe now, aren't we?
RIGSY: They can't get through, can they?
CLARA: Wait.
(On the other side, the indistinct, wobbly people aim red energy at the flat wheel, and it becomes 3D again. They run.)
DOCTOR: They have a new ability. Of course they have. Now they're 3D, they can restore dimensions.

[Tunnel / Tardis]

(As wobbly Stan and PC Forrest lead the rest of the figures through the door, Clara leads the men in a run for their lives. These creatures are difficult to describe. Sort of made up of squares of the surface of people, which aren't stuck together and shift around a little as they move.)
DOCTOR: Clara, do you want the good news or the bad news?
CLARA: We're in the bad news! I'm living the bad news!
DOCTOR: The good news is I've come up with a theoretical way to send them back to their own dimension.
CLARA: Do it! Now!
DOCTOR: And that's the bad news. The Tardis doesn't have enough dimensional energy to pull it off.
CLARA: Great. What do you want me to do about it?
DOCTOR: Apparently these things can pump it out as fast as they can steal it.
CLARA: Maybe if I ask them really nicely, they'll fill you up again. Hey!
(Fenton reaches into Clara's bag, pulling the Tardis out.)
FENTON: Give me that machine! Hand it over!
(As Rigsy and Fenton struggle for the Twodis, the Tardis goes flying over a railing and down a ventilation shaft.)
CLARA: Doctor?
(It lands with a thump, and alarms sound.)
CLARA: Hello? Doctor? Look, can we please deal with this later? Because we need to move.
(The Tardis has completely lost power.)
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor, I dropped you down a hole. Where are you?
DOCTOR: I don't know. My shields have gone. Structural integrity is failing. Another blow like that and I've had it.
(He looks out of the tiny doors.)
DOCTOR: Er, I'm on the train lines. And there's a train coming. Of course there is. Short-term re-materialisation? Not enough power. Teleport? Not enough power. Re-route the heart of the Tardis through - not enough power! Not enough power!
(Train A113 is hurtling along the tracks, sounding its horn. The Tardis has, of course, landed on a crossing point, where the track which is sunk into concrete slabs, so there isn't the usual clearance for the train to just run over something so small.)
CLARA: Can't you move the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Clara, there is no power. The Tardis couldn't boil an egg at the moment. Listen, do what you can to get those people out of there. You're stronger than you know.
RIGSY: I wonder what they're like with ladders?
CLARA: No, I mean you move the Tardis. Like Addams Family.
(As the train bears down on him, the Doctor sticks his hand through the doors and turns the Tardis upright, then uses his fingers to walk along the concrete, over the recessed track and then slightly up a slope. He pulls his hand in and closes the door in order to celebrate with the Addams family theme tune.)
DOCTOR: Ha! Di di di.
(The vibration caused by the train coming down the tunnel knocks the Tardis over so that it is leaning towards the rail as the train bears down. The Doctor looks out, then dives underneath the console, reaches up and pulls something. Clara gets static in her earbud.)
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor?

[Track]

(Rigsy and Fenton have climbed down the ladder to the track.)
RIGSY: They'd be here if they were coming. Where are they?
FENTON: There's no other way down, right? Hey! I'm talking to you.
RIGSY: There is. An old service elevator near the mouth of the tunnel.
(Clara comes down the ladder.)
CLARA: We should go.
FENTON: Oh, no.
(Jerky shadows play against the light at the end of the tunnel.)
FENTON: And there's another train coming.
(The horn sounds behind them. This time it is 2M65, Not In Service, barrelling along towards them. Clara quickly sonicks the signals from green to red, and the driver puts on the brakes.)

[Tardis]

(The Doctor has his coat collar turned up, and is rubbing his hands to try and stay warm.)
DOCTOR: I don't know if you can still hear me out there, but the Tardis is now in siege mode. No way in, no way out. I managed to turn it on just before the train hit. But there's not enough power left now to turn it off.

[Track]

(The driver climbs down from his cab.)
BILL: What's going on? Why the red light?
CLARA: MI5. We've got a, er
FENTON: Blockage. In the tunnel.
(Rigsy runs back along the train.)
CLARA: Can we ram the blockage? The train's empty, isn't it?
BILL: Yeah, it's out of service, but you'd need someone to hold the dead man's handle. Won't run without it. Is this official? Because I've always wanted to ram something.
CLARA: Can we rig it to drive without that? Send it in with no driver?
(The train starts to move forward. Clara runs to board it.)
CLARA: Rigsy!

[Driver's cab]

CLARA: Er, what are you doing?
RIGSY: I'm going to ram them, buy you some time.
CLARA: You'll die.
RIGSY: Yeah, course I'll die. Now go!
CLARA: Well, why'd you want to do that?
RIGSY: Just go, okay? Let me do this.
CLARA: Okay, fine, yeah. And I'll always remember you.
RIGSY: Fine. Great
CLARA: Cos I was just going to do this.
(She takes a piece of stretchy cord and loops it around the handle and something lower down.)
CLARA: No driver required. And I really like that hair band, but I suppose I'll just take it, will I? And every time I look at it, I'll remember the hero who died to save it. Come on. You're not getting off that lightly. There's work that needs doing.
(Anquished Rigsy makes up his mind and they run back down the train, jumping off just before it becomes a mural on the side of the tunnel.)

[Track]

CLARA: I quite liked that hair band.
(Figures start rising out of the tunnel floor again. As they start to run back, Clara spots a small box with circular Gallifreyan symbols on each side lying by the rails. She picks it up.)
RIGSY: What is it?
CLARA: I think it's the Tardis.
(They run.)

[Office]

(Clara is staring at the cube and tapping her earbud, whilst the train driver is brought up to speed with the plot. This office hasn't been used in a long time. There is a typewriter on a desk, old filing cabinets and a long table.)
BILL: They wear your skin?
FENTON: I never thought I'd say this
BILL: This is insane.
FENTON: But I think preferred them when they were flat.
BILL: What do you mean flat?
CLARA: Doctor?
(Nothing.)
CLARA: Doctor? What would you do now? No. What will I do now? Okay, okay, okay. Okay, the last thing the Doctor said was that the Tardis needed energy. He said if it gets energy, he can beat them.

[Tardis]

(The scanner is still sort of working.)
DOCTOR: No, no, no. What are you doing?

[Office]

(Clara is having an idea. She unrolls an old advertising poster for Bristol LMR out on the table and turns it over, blank side up. She uses the Tardis as a paperweight and shakes a handy paint spray can.)
FENTON: Leave her. She's lost it.
RIGSY: Are you okay?
CLARA: Yeah, are you?
RIGSY: I think I will be. What's this?
CLARA: Come on, Graffiti Boy, I've got a commission for you.
(She throws him the spray can.)
RIGSY: I'm flattered but I don't think this is exactly the time
CLARA: Well, fine, if you don't think you're up to it.
RIGSY: What do you need, exactly?

[Service tunnel]

(The Tardis is placed on a metal ledge, and the trio wait the other side of a two dimensional locked door.)
FENTON: You're going to get us killed. This plan's insane.
CLARA: You want to walk? Walk. You want to stay? Then shush!
BILL: They're coming!
(The strange facsimiles of people stagger along the track to the door.)

[Tardis]

(Time is running out for the Doctor.)
DOCTOR: Life support failing. I don't know if you'll ever hear this, Clara. I don't even know if you're still alive out there.
(The wobbly people aim their red energy at the flat wheel on the steel door.)
DOCTOR: But you were good! And you made a mighty fine Doctor.

[Service tunnel]

(More and more energy is poured in, and still the wheel stays flat. On the other side of the wall -)
FENTON: It's not working. You've killed us all.
BILL: This is going to save us? Pumping energy into the wall?
CLARA: No. Not into the wall. Through the wall. Rule number one of being the Doctor. Use your enemy's power against them.
(The door is directly on the other side of the wall from where the Tardis was placed, and the red energy is streaming into it.)
CLARA: They can't restore three dimensions to a door that never existed.
(The poster starts to peel off the wall. The Tardis shakes and power is restored inside. The Doctor runs to the console and starts using controls. Finally, the cube flies off the ledge, changes shape and flies through the air with its familiar sound, growing bigger and bigger until it lands full sized with a thump by the 3D facsimile people. It puts out a forcefield that pushes them away down the track.)
CLARA: It worked. They charged the Tardis.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: I tried to talk. I want you to remember that. I tried to reach out, I tried to understand you, but I think that you understand us perfectly.

[Train shed]

(The Doctor's words come over the tannoy system.)
DOCTOR [OC]: And I think you just don't care. And I don't know whether you are here to invade, infiltrate or just replace us.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: I don't suppose it really matters now. You are monsters. That is the role you seem determined to play. So it seems I must play mine.

[Track]

(The Doctor steps out of the Tardis. Clara, Rigsy and Fenton come down the ladder.)
DOCTOR: The man that stops the monsters. I'm sending you back to your own dimension. Who knows? Some of you may even survive the trip. And, if you do, remember this. You are not welcome here. This plane is protected. I am the Doctor.
(He turns, and Clara throws him the sonic screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: And I name you The Boneless.
(He zaps the forcefield, and pulses of energy make the Boneless disintegrate with a squeal.)

[Waste ground]

(The Tardis materialises. The Doctor, Clara, train driver Bill and Fenton get out, followed by Rigsy who closes the door. Bill gets down on his knees and kisses the ground. Clara chuckles. Rigsy makes a phone call on Clara's phone.)
RIGSY: Hi, Mum. It's me.
CLARA: You all right?
BILL: I'm alive, and I've been inside that. I think I'm up on the deal. Come here.
(Bill and Clara hug. Rigsy is walking away whilst speaking to his mum and Fenton is retying his boot laces.)
BILL: Thank you. (to Fenton) You look chipper.
(Bill walks away.)
CLARA: Do people still say chipper?
DOCTOR: Apparently. Are you okay?
CLARA: I'm alive.
DOCTOR: And a lot of people died.
FENTON: It's like a forest fire, though, isn't it? The objective is to save the great trees, not the brushwood. Am I right?
DOCTOR: It wasn't a fire, those weren't trees, those were people.
FENTON: They were Community Payback scumbags, I wouldn't lose any sleep.
DOCTOR: I bet you wouldn't.
FENTON: It's good to be alive though. Thank you. Seriously, thank you.
(And he walks off, too.)
DOCTOR: Yes, a lot of people died and maybe the wrong people survived.
CLARA: Yeah, but we saved the world, right?
DOCTOR: We did. You did.
CLARA: Okay, so, on balance
DOCTOR: Balance?
CLARA: Yeah, that's how you think, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Largely so other people don't have to.
CLARA: Yeah, well, I was you today. I was the Doctor. And, apparently, I was quite good at it.
DOCTOR: You heard that, did you?
CLARA: Yeah, but the power was going off so I suppose you were delirious. You didn't know what you were saying.
DOCTOR: Yes.
(Rigsy has finished his call with a 'love you' and returns to the Doctor and Clara.)
DOCTOR: Ah! The return of the fluorescent pudding brain.
CLARA: You do realise he can hear you now?
DOCTOR: I know. Your last painting was so good it saved the world. I can't wait to see what you do next.
RIGSY: (chuckles) It's not going to be easy. I've got a hair band to live up to. Thanks.
 (He holds out his hand to Clara, and she pulls him in for a hug.)
CLARA: Come here.
(Rigsy leaves.)
CLARA: Admit it. I did well.
(Her phone rings. It is Danny. She picks the I'm in a meeting text option to end it.)
DOCTOR: Is that PE?
CLARA: Just say it. Why can't you just say it? Why can't you just say I did good?
DOCTOR: Talk to soldier boy.
CLARA: It's not him. Come on, why can't you say it? I was the Doctor and I was good.
DOCTOR: You were an exceptional Doctor, Clara.
CLARA: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Goodness had nothing to do with it.
(Mae West, 'Night After Night' 1932.)

[Room]

(Our mysterious Edwardian lady is apparently monitoring all this on her tablet computer. She is looking at a live feed of Clara's face on it.)
MISSY: Clara. My Clara. I have chosen well.
(She laughs.)


[Forest]

(A schoolgirl runs through the dappled light of a forest until she finds an incongruous blue Police Box. She knocks on the door and it is opened by a tall man who has to look down to see her.)
MAEBH: I'm lost. Please, can you help me?
DOCTOR: It's that way.
(He shuts the door then opens it again and stares at the forest.)
DOCTOR: Are those trees?
MAEBH: I need the Doctor. Are you the Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes. Do you have an appointment? You need an appointment to see the Doctor.
MAEBH: Please. Something's chasing me.

[Tardis]

(He lets her inside and she gasps. The Doctor does the explanation with hand gestures.)
DOCTOR: When you drink a glass of Coke, it's only this big, but it's actually got this much sugar in it. It works a bit like that.
MAEBH: What does?
DOCTOR: The Tardis. It's bigger on the inside than the outside, or did you not notice?
(She follows him up to the gallery, where he picks up and unfolds a street map of London.)
MAEBH: I just thought it was supposed to be bigger on the inside, so I didn't say anything.
DOCTOR: Well, of course it's supposed to be bigger. Most people are confused by that.
MAEBH: I find everything confusing, nearly. So, I don't say anything. That's how come I'm in the woods. I thought Miss Oswald told me to find the Doctor. But it wasn't her.
It was just in my head.
DOCTOR: Miss Oswald? Dark hair? Highly unpredictable? Surprisingly round face?
MAEBH: Everyone says she's in love with Mister Pink.
DOCTOR: The PE teacher.
MAEBH: Maths. I really like him. I was in his group.
DOCTOR: Mister Pink was looking after you? Well, that explains why you're lost.
(He discards the map and they go back down to the console.)
DOCTOR: It doesn't surprise you that I know all about your school?
MAEBH: Everyone seems to know everything about everything, apart from me.
DOCTOR: That's not quite true. I, for instance, have no idea why,  when the terrestrial navigation
(Maebh is about to touch a control, so he thumps the console.)
DOCTOR: The terrestrial navigation starts up, it closes down all the other systems.
MAEBH: You should ask somebody who knows.
DOCTOR: Hmm. That's another of the drawbacks of being the last of your species. No one to ask when your Tardis won't start.
(He sets the time rotor going. It stops after a few seconds. The terrestrial navigation lady speaks.)
TER-NAV: You have reached your destination.
DOCTOR: No, we haven't. We're supposed to be in the middle of London.
TER-NAV: You have reached your destination.
DOCTOR: Oh, stop saying that!
MAEBH: She's only saying it because it's true. We are in the middle of London.
DOCTOR: We are in the middle of a forest.
MAEBH: Come and see.
(She takes his hand and leads him outside.)

[Trafalgar Square]

MAEBH: Nelson's Column. Do you like it?
DOCTOR: Do I. Sorry, what?
MAEBH: Do you like the forest being in Trafalgar Square? I think it's lovely.
(They look up, past one of Landseer's bronze lions to a tall Corinthian column with ivy growing up it, which is topped by a 5 1/2 metre sandstone statue of a famous one-armed Admiral of the Royal Navy, gazing southwards over a lush green forest amongst the buildings of central London.)

[London Zoological Museum]

(A display of stuffed wolves look down on the children in their sleeping bags. A bright light shines across them then homes in on a dark-skinned boy, who wakes up.)
SAMSON: Bradley! Sir! Tell him, sir! He's blinding me.
DANNY: Give me that, Bradley.
BRADLEY: I'm allowed a torch, sir. I've got a note. I'm darkness phobic.
SAMSON: Just because he's scared of the dark, sir, is he allowed to blind me?
DANNY: You're allowed a torch, Bradley, not a pocket supernova. Okay, listen up. A few things to run through before we head home. Put your phone away, Bradley. Thank you.
First, collect any rubbish you may have generated through midnight feasts or whatever
(A little later, dressed in  their school uniforms, the children follow their teachers into the main foyer where a stuffed tiger is on display.)
DANNY: Hello? Hello?
(One chubby girl with pigtails stops at a display of a section cut through a large tree trunk.)
RUBY: Look at this. Why is this one so fat, miss?
CLARA: Because it was alive so long.
RUBY: This ring, though. All the other rings are thin, but this one's fat and red, see?
CLARA: Must have been a good year to be a tree.
(The elderly night watchman turns up.)
GEORGE: I should have been relieved, you know.
DANNY: Oh, Coal Hill School. Sleepover.
GEORGE: Shush, shush!
(He takes the bar off the main entrance then enters numbers on a code pad very slowly and carefully. The boys sigh. It unlocks, but refuses to open.)
GEORGE: Hang on. There's a knack to this.
(He returns to the code pad.)
DANNY: No, no, no, no, no. It moved. It moved. It's jammed, it's not locked. Come on, team.
BRADLEY: What team?
(Teachers and pupils all push at the doors until they open.)
SAMSON: Wow! Sir, where are we?
DANNY: What do you mean, where are we?

[Outside the museum]

(A red double decker bus is stranded amongst the trees.)
RUBY: We can't have been asleep for that long, can we?
(Souvenir photographs of the forest are taken on mobile phones. Danny goes up to the roof to survey the terrain. Only the taller buildings and landmarks are visible above the canopy. We are then treated to a view of a very green Earth, then various news reports from around the world.)
JENNY HILL: (BBC on a railway track) Well, you've heard of leaves on the line. This is going to be slightly harder to clear 
ACCRA REPORTER: (In front of an overgrown goal.) In three hours' time, the Ghana Black Stars are due to play Sierra Leone in the African Cup of Nations.
PARIS REPORTER: Est-ce que c'est bien le Bois de Boulogne? Non, c'est le centre-ville.
ACCRA REPORTER: It does not look like the pitch will be ready.
(Clara makes a phone call from a bus stop. The woodpeckers are having a wonderful time in the trees. So where are all the pigeons?)
CLARA: You're always showing me amazing things. Well, I, Doctor, have finally got something amazing to show you.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Yes, well, there are some things I've never seen, but that's usually because I've chosen not to see them. Even my incredibly long life is too short for Les Miserables.
CLARA [OC]: Oh, Doctor.

[Bus stop]

CLARA: You're going to love this.
DOCTOR [OC]: Well, when you come to collect this child, you can tell me then.
CLARA: Huh? What child?

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Young female human. Standard defenceless little girl. Your friend Mister Pink was supposed to be looking after her.

[Bus stop]

CLARA: She probably has a name.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Good point. You. Have you got a name at all?
MAEBH:  Maebh. (pronounced May-v, because it is Welsh.) My name's Maebh.

[Bus stop]

CLARA: What? Maebh?

[Tardis]

CLARA [OC]: Where are you?
DOCTOR: Trafalgar

[Bus stop]

DOCTOR [OC]: Square.I found her wandering around the

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Brand new forest.

[Bus stop]

CLARA: Brand new forest?
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes. It's like the

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: New Forest, except even newer.

[Bus stop]

CLARA: Is that the forest that's covering London?
DOCTOR [OC]: Was that the amazing thing you were going to show me?'

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: It is amazing, but I saw it first.

[Bus stop]

CLARA: Look, is she all right? Will you bring her over?
DOCTOR: No, I can't

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Bring her over. I'm a Time Lord, not a childminder.
CLARA [OC]: You've got a spaceship.

[Bus stop]

CLARA: All we've got are Oyster cards.
DOCTOR [OC]: And

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: I've got a global rapid afforestation crisis to deal with.

[London Zoological Museum]

(Clara goes back inside.)
DANNY: What did they say?
CLARA: Who?
DANNY: The school. Parents. You were just on the phone.
CLARA: Oh, yeah. Rang school and parents. Yes, of course. Thought that was the priority.
DANNY: And?
CLARA: And I couldn't get through. Left messages. I'll try again.
DANNY: You didn't call the school. You called him.
CLARA: No, he called me, actually. I can't stop him calling me, can I?
DANNY: I thought you weren't in contact.
CLARA: London has just been taken over by a gigantic forest. Who do you want to talk to, Monty Don?
DANNY: I want to do my job, which is looking after these kids.
CLARA: Oh, really? How many kids?
DANNY: What?
CLARA: Where's Maebh Arden?
(Arden as in Forest of Arden? Danny looks around.)
CLARA: She's with the Doctor.
DANNY: What? No, no, no, no, no. Maebh is a vulnerable kid. She's on medication. She's had an emotional trauma. He. Has he even been CRB checked?
CLARA: He didn't abduct her. She was lost. He found her.
BRADLEY: I thought you said they were in love. Why are they shouting at each other?
RUBY: That's what people do when they're in love. Don't you know anything?

[Cromwell Road]

(A tree has grown up through a bicycle, lifting it high into the air. More buses and taxis are stranded.)
SAMSON: Where are we actually going? Where is he taking us?
(They stop by an Underground station sign.)
DANNY: Who wants to be a navigator?
(Lots of hands go up.)
CHILDREN: Me, me, me!
(Danny selects Bradley by handing him something.)
DANNY: Good lad. Let's do this.
BRADLEY: (to Samson) What's an avigator?
DANNY: We'll follow the lamp posts. That will keep us on Cromwell Road. We'll be able to orientate ourselves.
RUBY: I thought we were getting a coach. Where's the coach?
DANNY: Well, Ruby, it seems there are a lot of trees in the way.
RUBY: Why can't we just wait here until they've gone?
DANNY: Because trees don't just disappear, Ruby.
RUBY: They just came. Why wouldn't they just go?
(Outside the Natural History Museum, according to the sign.)
CLARA: The question is, how did they get here? Can a forest grow overnight, or have we been asleep for years, like Sleeping Beauty?
DANNY: No, the question is, how are we going to get these kids home?
CLARA: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That is the big question.
DANNY: Okay, team. It's crucial we stick together. If you start to fall behind, don't. Bradley, we're going to head north east first to collect Maebh from Trafalgar Square, then we're going south to the river. Come on, keep up!
(Groans.)
RUBY: What's he talking about? Where are we going?
CLARA: You are enjoying this just a little bit too much. Come on. Are you not even a little bit curious about how? Who? Why? When?
DANNY: I am curious. I am bewildered. I am, in fact, enchanted. But I'm not the priority. The kids are.
CLARA: You see, now, that attitude is (sotto) actually very attractive.

MINISTER [on TV} The Government emergency committee, COBRA, has formulated an action plan. We will create pathways through the trees using carefully controlled fires. This will facilitate the movement of essential services.

[Trafalgar Square]

(The Doctor is standing on the lion's plinth scanning the trees while Maebh watches the broadcast on her phone.)
MINISTER [on phone]: We are therefore asking you to stay in your homes. Fill your baths, sinks, and any buckets with fresh water.
DOCTOR: Why would there be no reading? Because they are actually made of wood. No circuits. No mechanism. Wood.
(He jumps down to the ground. The National Gallery is in the background.)
MAEBH: What's this for?
DOCTOR: This is a sonic screwdriver. It interacts with any form of communication you care to mention. Sadly, trees have no moving parts and don't communicate.
MAEBH: They communicate a bit, though.
DOCTOR: What?
MAEBH: Otherwise they wouldn't all grow at the same time, would they.
DOCTOR: So, what, do you think that's how spring begins? With a group message on Tree Facebook? Do you think they send texts to each other?
MAEBH: You don't need a phone to communicate, do you. I haven't phoned home, and I know my mum is worried about me.

[Arden home]

(On the phone.)
MAEBH'S MUM: You said you'd collect Maebh. It's all right, I'm collecting her. Soon as I find my car keys. I can't see a thing. Next door have planted bloody Hydrangeas and they've gone mental! I've had words with her about it before. She's
(Then she opens the front door.)
MAEBH'S MUM: Oh. I'll call you back.

[Brompton Road]

(Passing shop windows.)
RUBY: Miss, in the museum, right, I was reading about reproduction
CLARA: Oh, Ruby, this really isn't the right moment
RUBY: And that said that trees have blossom, and then that turns into fruit or seeds or nuts. Right?
CLARA: Right, Ruby.
RUBY: These trees have got blossom and nuts.
CLARA: Oh, yeah. That is strange.
(They reach Knightsbridge Underground Station.)
SAMSON: Nuts. That's unfortunate for you, isn't it, Bradley? You have an allergy, don't you? What if one of them falls on your head? Do you die, or swell up like a massive melon?
BRADLEY: Shut it!

[Outside the Arden home]

(Their neighbour, a black woman, is also not pleased with the all the extra greenery in their street.)
NEIGHBOUR: I think we should have been consulted. What's it in aid of, even?
MAEBH'S MUM: How far does this go? I need to collect Maebh.

[Trafalgar Square]

(The school outing arrives at the lion.)
DANNY: Trafalgar Square. Well done, Bradley. Excellent navigation skills.
(Clara sees the Tardis.)
CLARA: Ah ha! There it is. All sorted now. Come on.
BRADLEY: Can we take a picture with the lion, sir? Please?
DANNY: Er, stay together, but okay.
(The selfies don't show much of the lion.)
CLARA: I cannot believe Bradley just said please.
DANNY: Really?
CLARA: Yeah. He usually prefers other means of persuasion.

[Memory - English classroom]

BRADLEY: Give it! Give it! Miss! He won't lend me his dictionary.
(Clara doesn't look up from her marking.)
CLARA: You could try saying please, Bradley.
BOY: Ow!
(The crash makes Clara look up from her marking. A desk has been overturned. Bradley is sent out of the classroom.)

[Trafalgar Square]

CLARA: And Ruby

[Memory - Maths classroom]

(Danny draws a right angled triangle then marks the topmost angle with an X.)
DANNY: And how do we find X? Ruby?
RUBY: It's there, sir. At the top.
DANNY: No, how do we find
RUBY: It's not lost. It's there at the top, Look!
DANNY: No, how do we find the value of X?
RUBY: Why are you asking me all the questions? Give someone else a go.

[Trafalgar Square]

CLARA: You bring out the best in them.
(There is a rumble, and Nelson's column sways a little. Ruby slides down from the pedestal holding a piece of broken branch.)
RUBY: Ow! Look, sir. No rings. Trees usually have rings to tell you how old they are. This one's got no rings. Why's that then, sir?
DOCTOR: The rings mark the years of growth. One ring for each year. This grew up overnight. That whole tree is the result of just one night's growth, and they're still growing.
CLARA: Everyone, this is the Doctor, and he's going to sort everything out. Isn't that right, Doctor? It's what he does.
DOCTOR: Well, having looked at things, I think, probably, the answer to that is no.
CLARA: He always says that. He's really clever.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I am. Very clever. But what use is clever against trees? They don't listen to reason. You can't plead with them. You can't lie to them. They have no moving parts, no circuits. This is a natural event.
DANNY: How can it be natural for a tree to grow in one night?
DOCTOR: Exactly what they said about the Ice Age. How can whole glaciers just pop up out of nowhere? Well, they just did. That's how this planet grows - a series of catastrophes. Farewell to the Ice Age. Welcome to the Tree Age. Possibly. When the Ice Age was here, you lot managed to cook mammoth. Now there's a forest, you'll just have to eat nuts.
BRADLEY: I can't eat nuts. I've got an allergy.
CLARA: Don't worry. It's a thing he does. He pretends he's not interested and then he has an idea. He's playing for time.
DOCTOR: Time. Interesting.
CLARA: See? Clever kicking in.
DOCTOR: A tree is a time machine. You plant a little acorn in 1795, and in the year 2016, there's an oak tree, there, in the same spot, with a tiny little bit of 1795 still alive inside of it. You can't create an overnight forest with extra special fertiliser. You have to mess with the fabric of time. And communicate with trees.
(He runs into the Tardis, and Clara follows.)

[Tardis]

(Then Danny and the children.)
CLARA: So you're saying it's an act of aggression?
DOCTOR: By trees?
RUBY: Er, trees clean the air.
CLARA: Exactly. Well done, Ruby. Someone or something who's trying to scrub the atmosphere before colonising or invading. Ah, yes, Doctor. Ahem. This is Coal Hill Year Eight Gifted and Talented Group.
SAMSON: What are the round bits for?
DOCTOR: Ask your teacher. Come on! Down from there!  Hey! Away from the console. Come on. That's an antique. Get away from there! Don't touch that!
(The children are playing with the controls.)
DOCTOR: Haven't any of you been struck by the fact that it's, look, it's bigger on the inside?
RUBY: There wasn't a forest. Then there was a forest. Nothing surprises us any more.
DOCTOR: These trees all appeared at once. That wasn't a coincidence. There's no such thing as an arboreal coincidence. Something, someone has coordinated this. To coordinate, you need to communicate. Every communication channel on the Tardis is open, and nothing.
(Danny sees a pile of school exercise books and picks the top ones up. He looks at someone's drawings of an angry sun sending zig zags towards tree tops.)
DOCTOR: Except. Let me see that.
DANNY: Homework books. Why are these here?
(They look at the name on the front.)
DOCTOR: Maebh Arden. Maebh Arden. Which one is Maebh Arden? Which one's Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh?
(The Doctor looks at each child in turn whilst saying the name.)
RUBY: Oh, my God. Maebh's gone. Maebh's lost in the forest. Maebh's going to die!
DOCTOR: Argh!
CLARA: Ruby, that's enough! Doctor?
DOCTOR: We've got to find her!
CLARA: Yes, I know that we have to find her. Doctor, listen to me. Her sister went missing last year. She's on medication. The child is barely functioning. She hears voices. She's very vulnerable.
DOCTOR: What do the voices say?
CLARA: I don't know. She takes tablets and they stop.
DOCTOR: You people. You never learn. If a child is speaking, listen to it.
DANNY: Oh, like you listened to her?
(The Doctor turns on the scanner, and it shows a large solar prominence flaring off.)
DOCTOR: He's right. She was trying to tell me something and I ignored her. Maebh Arden is tuned to a different channel. She can lead us to the source, to the heart of the forest. We have to listen to her. We have to find her.
CLARA: Not everything can be fixed with a screwdriver. It's not a magic wand.
DOCTOR: Does she have a phone?
CLARA: Well, yes, she does.
DOCTOR: Have you got the number?
CLARA: Er, yep.
(The Doctor sonicks Clara's phone. )
DOCTOR: Maebh Arden. Five hundred yards south east of here. I'll go get her.
DANNY: I'll go with him.
CLARA: Oh, I can go. You can
DANNY: You haven't seen him for months?
(The Doctor leaves.)
CLARA: Something like that.
DANNY: You didn't even say hello. You just sprung straight into action. Special unit.
RUBY: This is so cool.
(The Doctor rushes back in. The children are taking photographs.)
DOCTOR: Hey! Do not. Touch. Anything. Anything. H-h-okay?
RUBY: Okay.
CLARA: See? Someone needs to go. Child protection.

[Northumberland Avenue]

DOCTOR: Gifted and talented? Really?
(They pass a stranded taxi.)
CLARA: Furious, fearful, tongue-tied. They're all superpowers if you use them properly. Are they going to be all right?
(The nearby traffic lights go out. Presumably the growing tree roots are disrupting the cables.)
DOCTOR: They're in the Tardis, the safest place on the planet.
(Another rumble, and they look up to see Horatio falling towards them. They throw themselves forward and the statue just misses.)
DOCTOR: If this is an invasion
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: It's over. They're here, they've won. What do they want?

[Trafalgar Square]

(The children come out of the Tardis, coughing in the stone dust.)
RUBY: I'm not just going to stand here and let her die.
DANNY: Who?
RUBY: Miss. You let her go off with some randomer into the forest. You're supposed to be madly in love with her.
DANNY: I'm? Who said that?
RUBY: Everyone.
SAMSON: She's probably dead now anyway. Crushed by Nelson.
RUBY: What if the trees collapse on her, and kill her?
DANNY: You're worrying too much.
RUBY: Yeah, but what if the wild animals come out and eat her?
DANNY: Ruby, you're letting your imagination run away with you.
RUBY: I'm not, though, am I, because I haven't got an imagination. You can ask Miss Oswald.
DANNY: Okay, then. Come on, team, let's do this.
SAMSON: We will, if you stop calling us a team.

[Forest]

(Riding a bicycle along a track.)
MAEBH'S MUM: Maebh!

[Northumberland Avenue]

CLARA: Doctor? Look behind us. The path we just walked down. It's overgrown already.
(The Doctor picks up a pink phone.)
DOCTOR: Clara!
CLARA: Why would she put her phone down?
DOCTOR: Doesn't want to be followed? Lost a hold of it in a struggle? Left it as a clue, so we would know where she was going? Trail of breadcrumbs. Hansel and Gretel.
CLARA: I'm actually frightened. I never get frightened. Why am I frightened?
DOCTOR: You just lost a little girl.
CLARA: Yes, that is a worry, but I know you'll find her. No, no, no. This is not a worry, this is a dread. Maebh!
DOCTOR: You're pursuing a little lost girl through a mysterious forest. The path has disappeared. You find yourself with a strangely compelling masculine figure. Maebh!
CLARA: Any minute now we're going to find a gingerbread cottage with a cannibal witch inside. Maebh!
DOCTOR: Exactly. The forest. It's in all the stories that kept you awake at night. The forest is mankind's nightmare.

[Forest]

(Maebh is running and waving her hands to waft away the invisible midges. She stops to put her bright red school pencil case on the ground then runs on until she sees a group of people in hazmat suits at an Underground station. She runs away, waving her hands in the air again, pausing only to put down her pink lunch box.)
DOCTOR: Clara. Is it hers?
(The pencil case. Note - are those Converse All Star trainers that Clara is wearing, like David Tennant used to?)
CLARA: Yes. Clever girl.
(She strides past a bus stop, pushes aside a branch and is confronted by a hazmat suit worn by one of several men. These must be the Emergency Service Officers on the cast list.)
ESO: Get back! We're burning here. Stay back.
CLARA: We're looking for a little girl.
ESO: Stay back. We're about to burn.
(The flame thrower is set to work on a small tree.)
ESO: Good job!
(But without the flame thrower feeding them, the flames slowly go out.)
ESO: What's going on? Trees aren't responding to flame-thrower. I mean, they don't catch fire. They just don't catch. It's like they're flame proof or something.
(The Doctor and Clara walk on.)
DOCTOR: Trees control the oxygen on this planet. They withhold it, they smother the fire. What sort of forest is clever? What sort of forest has its own in-built fire extinguisher?
CLARA: What do they want?
DOCTOR: Why now?
CLARA: What do you mean, why now?
DOCTOR: The whole natural order is turning against this planet. But why? Why now?
CLARA: Well, what else?
(The Doctor takes Maebh's homework book from his pocket and shows Clara the drawings.)
DOCTOR: How did she know this?
CLARA: What is it?
DOCTOR: This is a massive solar flare headed for Earth, like the one that destroyed the Bank of Karabraxos. I've got an entire Tardis and I didn't notice this. But she knew. How?
CLARA: This is Maebh's. Where did you get this?
DOCTOR: You left your marking in the Tardis.
CLARA: Oh, great, right, well, that's just brilliant, isn't it. You don't think Danny saw this, do you?
DOCTOR: I've just informed you that a solar flare is going to wipe out your planet. You're worried about a row with your boyfriend. How did she know this? She even put the date on it!
CLARA: I always make them date their homework.
DOCTOR: It's today's date.
CLARA: Well, there must be a way?
DOCTOR: They want something. They're saying something. If there is a way, the way is Maebh Arden.
CLARA: Okay, you know they're not really gifted and talented, don't you? I just tell them that to make them feel good.
DOCTOR: She's lost someone. People who've lost someone, they're always listening, always looking, always hoping. So, they notice more. They hear more.
(A wolf howls.)
CLARA: Was that a howl?
(A second animal replies.)
CLARA: Was that a wolf? No. That is impossible. We're in London.
DOCTOR: Would that be the London with the zoo? The zoo with the pack of wolves? The zoo whose barriers and gates have probably been mangled by the trees? No, wolves are not impossible. Stick to the path, Red Riding Hood.
CLARA: There is no path.
(The pack howls.)
DOCTOR: Then we're lunch.
(Maebh is still running and waving her hands. She stops as something growls nearby. A pair of eyes glitter in the foliage behind her. She turns, sees the wolf and screams. The Doctor and Clara hear her.)
CLARA: Maebh?
(Maebh runs. The wolf gives chase. The Doctor and Clara run. Maebh arrives at a wrought iron fence. The pack is behind her. Suddenly, Clara is on the other side of the fence.)
CLARA: Maebh! Doctor, give me a boost so I can pull her over. Maebh? Maebh!
(Maebh runs to the nearby gate and goes through.)
DOCTOR: Maebh. You came looking for me. You didn't
(Maebh starts waving her hands around again, trying to swat away midges.)
DOCTOR: Maebh, Maebh, you didn't just stumble into the Tardis. Tell me what you know.
CLARA: Doctor
DOCTOR: This is important.
CLARA: Yes. Can we please deal with the wolves first?
DOCTOR: These are zoo wolves. They're not even used to hunting.
CLARA: Doctor!
(The three wolves show their teeth.)
DOCTOR: All right, okay. We've just got to look as if we're too much bother to eat, right? So, stay still. Stay together. Look big. Look big like a big three-headed, six-legged scary thing!
(The wolves jump over the fence and run away, whining.)
DOCTOR: Ha ha! Told you they were rubbish. Those wolves are terrified.
CLARA: What are wolves frightened of?
(A deep throaty growl answers the question. It is a large cat with the sort of stripes that make it almost invisible in dense woodland. It walks up to the fence and roars, showing off its magnificent canine teeth.)
DOCTOR: There are very good solid scientific reasons for being really quite frightened just now.
(A bright light is shone in the tiger's face. It doesn't like it, and retreats. It is Danny with Bradley's torch, and the rest of the children are behind him. They all cheer.)
CLARA: Mister Pink! Why, thank you very much.
DANNY: Ah, no problem. Just decided it was best not to leave you alone with him. They've worked well together. Noticeable increase in confidence and energy levels.
(Maebh is waving her arms again, and the Doctor is looking at her curiously.)
CLARA: Well done. And for saving us from a tiger, too.
DANNY: Er, has she had her medication yet?
CLARA: Oh. No, I
DOCTOR: No, no. Not her medication. We don't want to shut her up. We want to know what she knows. Maebh, what's the. Maebh, what is this? What is this?
(The Doctor imitates Maebh's hand waving.)
DANNY: Apart from being almost savaged by a tiger and abducted by a Scotsman, she's allowed any nervous tics she likes, okay?
DOCTOR: This is not a nervous tic. This is react
RUBY: Please! Just give her her tablets. She's been in a state since her sister went missing.
(Maebh runs off.)  
DANNY: Maebh! Maebh! Maebh!
(Danny and the other children go through the gate and run after her.)
RUBY: You won't find your sister out there.

[Clearing]

(Maebh arrives at cobweb festooned small trees surrounding a circular open area, with two deckchairs and a Union Flag in the background. The low sun through the trees is beautiful. They catch up to her.)
RUBY: Miss? What is it, miss?
MAEBH: It's coming. It's coming for everyone, and I can't unthink it.
DOCTOR: Maebh. Maebh, this forest is communicating. With you. Nobody else. No technology can hear what it's saying, but you can. Tell us what it wants. Where it came from. Just tell me who did this.
MAEBH: It was me. I did this. I did these trees.
DOCTOR: No, Maebh. You didn't make a global forest appear overnight. How could you do that?
MAEBH: Thoughts come to me. Ever since Annabel went missing, I look for her everywhere. I don't find her, but I find thoughts. The big forest was one. I thought everyone would love it. The thoughts! The thoughts! They go so fast.
BRADLEY: This is stressing me now. When I get stressed, I forget my anger management.
CLARA: Maebh, can you see something that we can't see?
MAEBH: Nearly. Too fast. Everywhere.
DOCTOR: Everything's subject to gravity. If I can create a little local increase
(The Doctor brandishes his sonic screwdriver.)
DANNY: No. You're not experimenting on
(Golden dancing points of light appear around Maebh's head. These are the invisible midges she was trying to bat away with her hands.)
MAEBH: They're lovely! They don't like it when you're holding them. They want you to let them go.
DOCTOR: Who are they?
MAEBH + HERE: We are Here. Here, always, since the beginning and until the end.
DOCTOR: Here? That's it?
(The Here have a very deep voice that drowns out Maebh's higher pitched one.)
HERE: We are the green shoots that grow between the cracks, the grass that grows over the mass graves. After your wars are over, we will still be Here. We are the life that prevails.
DOCTOR: Why now? Why are you here now?
HERE: We hear the call and we come, as we came before to the great North Forest, where we lie still in a great circle. As we came to the vast Southern Forest.
DOCTOR: Who is calling you now?
HERE: The sun that creates. The sun that destroys. You are hurting us. Let us go.
DOCTOR: You sent for me. The girl came looking for me. Why? Why me?
HERE: We did not send. Pain. Did not send for you. We don't know you. We were here before you and will be here after you.
(The Doctor turns off the screwdriver.)
SAMSON: That was actually quite cool.
(Maebh falls to her knees. Danny and the Doctor go to her.)
DOCTOR: Maebh, you came looking for the Doctor. Think. Who sent you for the Doctor?
MAEBH: It was just a thought. It was just a thought that came. I think it came from Miss.
(Danny looks at Clara.)
MAEBH: They've gone. Why does everything have to go?
(The Doctor walks to the edge of the circle, and Clara goes to him.)
CLARA: This really is going to happen, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Stars implode. Planets grow cold. Catastrophe is the metabolism of the universe. I can fight monsters. I can't fight physics.
CLARA: Why would trees want to kill us? We love trees.
DOCTOR: You've been chopping them down for furniture for centuries. If that's love, no wonder they're calling down fire from the heavens.
CLARA: But we saw the future. Lots of futures. Earth's futures.
DOCTOR: They're about to be erased.
CLARA: If you can't save them all, save who you can. The Tardis. It's a lifeboat, isn't it? Not everybody has to die.
(The big solar flare forms. Meanwhile, Danny leads his team back to Trafalgar Square, singing like American GIs.)
DANNY: Everywhere we go-o-o!
CHILDREN: Everywhere we go-o-o!
DANNY: People wanna kno-o-ow!
CHILDREN:  People wanna kno-o-ow!
DANNY: Who we a-a-re.
CHILDREN:  Who we a-a-re.
DANNY: We are the Coal Hill Gifted and Talented
(Maebh's mother hears the voices and stops pedalling for a moment.)
CHILDREN:  We are the Coal Hill Gifted and Talented.

[Trafalgar Square]

(The Tardis is disappearing underneath ivy.)
DANNY: Right, come on, team.
(They pull at the greenery.)
CLARA: When they're done, you need to get in your box and go.
DOCTOR: We're all going. We're taking the kids.
CLARA: Taking them where? What are you going do with them? Leave them on an asteroid? Find a space academy for the gifted and talented? They just want their mums and dads, and they're never going to stop wanting them.
DOCTOR: I can save you and Danny.
CLARA: Danny Pink will never leave those kids so long as he is breathing.
(The door is uncovered. The children cheer.)
DANNY: Come on, team.
BRADLEY: Can we take another selfie, sir?
DANNY: Of course. Come on, then.
CHILDREN: Yes!
DOCTOR: I can save you.
CLARA: I don't want you to.
DOCTOR: What, you don't want to live?
CLARA: Of course I want to live. I just
DOCTOR: What?
CLARA: Don't make me say it.
DOCTOR: Say what?
CLARA: I don't want to be the last of my kind.
DOCTOR: Then why did you bring us all here?
CLARA: Because it's the only way to get you back to the Tardis, make you think you're saving someone. Well, you know what, Doctor? This time, the human race is saving you. 
(Clara unlocks the Tardis door.)
CLARA: Make it worthwhile.
DOCTOR: This is my world, too. I walk your earth, I breathe your air.
CLARA: And on behalf of this world, you're very welcome. Now, go. Save the next one.
DOCTOR: Maebh! I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.
MAEBH: You helped me loads. I thought it was all my fault. I feel much better now. Are you going to get rid of the forest?
CLARA: Hard to get rid of a flame-proof forest, Maebh, eh? Come on.
(Clara and Maebh join Danny and the boys at the lion. The Doctor goes into the Tardis while Samson tries to read the news headlines on his phone.)
SAMSON: Government crews have been deployed with the latest defo, deefoo
(Danny takes his phone and reads.)
DANNY: Defoliant agents, Samson. They're used to take the leaves off the trees so they're easier to burn.
BRADLEY: That's harsh.
(The Tardis engines start.)
BRADLEY: Where's he going?
CLARA: Home. He's going home. Which is exactly where we're going.

[Tardis]

(The Doctor looks at the growing solar flare on the scanner.)
DOCTOR: Flame-proof forest. Flame-proof forest. A thousand atom bombs and no one hurt. I am Doctor Idiot!

[Forest]

(Not many trees in this part.)
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara! Come back here! Come back!
DANNY: He's calling you.
CLARA: Yes. Let him call. This is more important.
(The Doctor comes running.)
DOCTOR: Clara! Mister Pink! Maebh! All of you! Quick, quick! Come back. Come back. Come on.
(The children turn and run back to him.)
DOCTOR: Maebh, quick. Good girl, good girl. Come on.

[Tardis]

(Teachers and pupils are sitting on the steps to the gallery while the Doctor gives his lesson on the solar flare.)
DOCTOR: It's there on the screen, look. Big solar flare headed this way. A thousand kilometres a second. Coronal mass ejection. Geomagnetic storm. It's huge. It's brewing up a solar wind
big enough to blow this whole planet away.
(Blank faces.)
DOCTOR: I assumed your teachers have mentioned this?
CLARA: I thought it would spoil an otherwise enjoyable walk.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay. Well, this is the bad news. The good news is, it's happened before. And you're still here. The Tunguska Blast, 1908. That should have blown the whole planet off its axis, but it didn't. It knocked a few trees over. Well, a few tens of thousands of trees over. Curu�� in Brazil. Same story. Earth should have been smashed, but it wasn't. What do these things have in common?
RUBY: They're really, really scaring us?
DOCTOR: Trees. Whenever there's a planet-threatening, extra-terrestrial impact, trees. Massive forest, filling the atmosphere with oxygen. Pumping it up like a massive, highly inflammable airbag, so that when trouble hits
SAMSON: Everyone dies.
DOCTOR: No. The impact burns off the excess oxygen. You have some fairly hectic weather for a few days and some fairly trippy looking sunsets, but apart from that, you will be all right. I was wrong. The trees are not your enemy. They're your shield. They've been saving you since for ever. Protecting you from everything that space can throw at you.
CLARA: The wide ring. The red ring. In the museum, Ruby saw a cross-section of a tree. One of the rings was wider than the others, and red.
DOCTOR: Atmospheric dust, captured by the trees. The fingerprint of an asteroid. Happy Red Ring Day.
RUBY: I don't get it. If they're good, then why are we chopping them down?
DANNY: The Government are sending out defoliating teams. They're dropping chemicals on them right now.
DOCTOR: What is it with you people? You hear voices, you want to shut them up. The trees come to save you, you want to chop them down.
CLARA: Or you think you need to save the world when it's already saving itself.
DOCTOR: I did admit that I was wrong. Excellent. Mobile networks are still operative. Right. We are going to call everyone on Earth and tell them to leave the trees alone.
MAEBH: Can I do it? I started it. I should finish it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay. Class project. Save the Earth.
(So the children sprawl on the floor by the console, making suggestions while Maebh writes her script.)
MAEBH: Okay. And I think that's it.
(The Doctor flicks a switch, and everyone's mobile phone rings inside the Tardis and around the good green world.

[Trafalgar Square]

(Including that of Maebh's mother, who has just arrived. She answers it.)
MAEBH [OC]: Essential services have been disrupted due to an unexpected forest.
MAEBH'S MUM: Maebh? Where are you?

[Tardis]

MAEBH: We'd like to reassure you that the situation will be rectified very soon. Please don't be scared. And please don't chop, spray or harm the trees. They're here to help. Be less scared. Be more trusting. Oh, and Annabel Arden, please come home.
(The Doctor ends the transmission.)
DOCTOR: Okay, who would like to witness a once in a billion years solar event at close quarters?
(Maebh looks at the scanner.)
MAEBH: Mum! There's my mum!

[Trafalgar Square]

(A joyful reunion.)
MAEBH'S MUM: I thought I'd lost you too.
MAEBH: Never. Not ever.
CLARA: So, trip to space, anyone?
RUBY: I want my mum.
SAMSON: I slightly want my mum, too.
CLARA: Tell them, Mister Pink, what an educational opportunity
DANNY: You, you go. This. This is enough for me.
CLARA: What? Coronal ejections, geomagnetic storms. How often do you get a playlist like that?
DANNY: I was a soldier. I put myself at risk. I didn't try too hard to survive, but somehow, here I am. And now I can see what I nearly lost. And it's enough. I don't want to see more things. I want to see the things in front of me more clearly. There are wonders here, Clara Oswald. Bradley saying please, that's a wonder. One person is more amazing, harder to understand, but more amazing than universes.
CLARA: Really? What person is that, then?
(Danny and Clara kiss. The children cheer and applaud.)
RUBY: I told you. I said so, didn't I?

[Brompton Road]

(Heading back to Cromwell Road, passing Knightsbridge tube.)
CLARA: We could have a picnic.
DANNY: You can't. You've got marking.
CLARA: Oh. Well, no, no, no. That was, er, from ages ago. You see, what happened was
DANNY: They always write the date neatly at the top of the page.
CLARA: Yeah, they do, don't they?
DANNY: Last Friday. You were on the Tardis last Friday. Today, you thought the world was going to end. You still didn't tell me the truth.
CLARA: I tried. He interrupted.
DANNY: I just want to know the truth. I don't care what it is. I just want to know it. Like Maebh said. Like the forest. Fear a little bit less, trust a bit more.
CLARA: Okay. Well
DANNY: No, not now. Go home and do your marking. Think about it, then tell me. I saved you from a tiger today. I deserve at least that.
CLARA: Yes, you did. And yes, you do.

[Space]

(Clara and the Doctor are looking out of the Tardis doorway.)
DOCTOR: I hope I'm right. It would be slightly awkward if the world was destroyed at this point.
CLARA: What?
(The solar flare reaches Earth's atmosphere, igniting the surplus oxygen as it flows around.)
DOCTOR: There goes the planet-sized airbag. That's the trees, harvesting the solar fire.

[Room]

(Someone else is watching it on their computer screen.)
MISSY: Now, that was surprising. And I love surprises.
(But she doesn't look as if she means it.)

[Clara's balcony]

(The Tardis is parked in the living room. As the Doctor and Clara watch, the forest disappears in a succession of golden sparkles, revealing the hidden buildings and roads.)
CLARA: That is amazing. How will they explain this tomorrow?
DOCTOR: You'll all forget it ever happened.
CLARA: We are not going to forget an overnight forest.
DOCTOR: You forgot the last time. You remembered the fear and you put it into fairy stories. It's a human superpower, forgetting. If you remembered how things felt, you'd have stopped having wars. And stopped having babies.
(The golden glow spreads over the planet and vanishes, leaving behind the familiar blue oceans and brown dry land. Shame. The reforestation of the Sahara might have been useful.)

[Outside the Arden home]

(Mother and daughter walk home, and Maebh spots a pair of eyes looking out from an overgrown Hydrangea in their neighbour's front garden. The bush disappears in a mass of golden sparkles and a girl stands up.)
MAEBH'S MUM: Annabel! My Annabel!
MAEBH:I knew you'd be here. The thought of you came to me.

[Park]

(Danny Pink walks past the magnificent war memorial in Alexandra Gardens, Cathays Park, Cardiff whilst pretending to be in Shoreditch, London. His mobile phone rings.)
DANNY: Clara!
CLARA [OC]: Shut up.
DANNY: Is that how we communicate now?

[Clara's flat]

CLARA: Shut up, shut up, shut up. I need to talk to you.

[Park]

DANNY: All right. Well, I'll be there in a couple of minutes, so

[Clara's flat]

No, no, Not while you're in the room.

[Park]

DANNY: Oh, stupid me. The very idea.

[Clara's flat]

CLARA: Shut up!
DANNY [OC]: Okay.
CLARA: Stay shut up.

[Park]

DANNY: Okay.
CLARA [OC]: Things to say.

[Clara's flat]

CLARA: Not all of them good.
DANNY [OC]: Oh, wouldn't it be better

[Park]

DANNY: If I was actually there?
CLARA [OC]: Oh, Danny, everything is

[Clara's flat]

CLARA: Better when you're here, but maybe
(She turns to look at the array of post-it notes on her bookshelves. Some say PSI, Impossible Girl, Saibra, Vastra, Blinovitch, Robin Hood, Lying, Dinosaur in London.)
CLARA: Maybe not this. Okay  Er. Okay, before all of that. Before all of the stuff

[Park]

CLARA [OC]: That I did wrong

[Clara's flat]

(She takes down the note that says Just Say It.)
CLARA: I love you.

[Road]

DANNY: I love you.
(Danny is walking out towards the main road.)
CLARA: No, not like that. Not like it's automatic.

[Clara's flat]

CLARA: Not like it's how you end the phone call, the sign off, the pat on the back.

[Park]

DANNY: Clara

[Clara's flat]

CLARA: Danny, I'll never say those words again. Not to anybody else, ever. Those words, from me, are yours now.
(Danny walks out onto the main road. Clara doesn't get a reply so after a pause -)
CLARA: So, er. That's a thing.
(Just the sound of cars travelling on the road.)
CLARA: Okay, Danny? Er, there's more but that's kind of the headline. Okay, Danny, please speak to me, This is, this is killing me.
(Still nothing.)
CLARA: Danny, I love you. And you are the last person who's ever going to hear me say that.
WOMAN [OC]: Hello? Hello, is someone there?
CLARA: Hello? Er, yeah. Who's this?
WOMAN [OC]: I just picked up the phone, I'm sorry. I found it.
CLARA: Oh. Er, okay. Er, can you please just put me back on the phone to Danny? I was talking to Danny.
WOMAN [OC]: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
CLARA: Okay, er, what are you sorry about? Could you please just pass the phone back to 
WOMAN [OC]: He was crossing the road. 'I found the phone, it must have just got thrown. The car, it just came out of nowhere.

[Road]

WOMAN: I'm so sorry.
(The traffic is at a standstill. People have stopped to look, and the emergency services are on their way, sirens wailing. Clara drops the phone and runs along the street. She gets there just as the police are taping the scene off.)

ARMITAGE [OC]: By now, I'm sure you've heard the rumours, and it is with great sadness that I must confirm them to be true.
(A little shrine with photographs, notes and flowers is set up at the park entrance.)
ARMITAGE [OC]: I have gathered you all here today to say that Mister Pink, that Danny Pink has sadly passed away. I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing his family and friends our sincerest condolences. Mister Pink was an inspiration to all of those who knew him. A soldier, a teacher, a friend. It was no secret that he had a close relationship with Miss Oswald, and our thoughts and prayers are with her too.
(The Tardis is sitting on a ledge in a volcanic caldera.)

[Clara's kitchen]

(Full of Calla lilies and sympathy cards. Her phone is ringing, and continues to ring throughout the scene. Caller ID says it is The Doctor calling. Clara's gran walks in.)
GRAN: Hello, love. You all right? Oh, of course you're not. Sorry. Of course you're not all right. You know what you should do? You should cry. Let go.
CLARA: Of what?
GRAN: It's a terrible thing. Just a terrible, terrible thing.
CLARA: It wasn't terrible.
GRAN: Clara?
CLARA: It was boring.
GRAN: Boring?
CLARA: It was ordinary. People just kept walking with their iPods and their shopping bags. He was alive, and then he was dead and it was nothing. Like stepping off a bus.
GRAN: He deserved better. And so did you.
CLARA: I don't deserve anything. Nobody deserves anything. But I am owed better. I am owed.
GRAN: Who owes you?
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara! Clara?
(Clara picks up the phone and puts on a cheerful face. So, she was actually calling him?)
CLARA: Hey!

[Tardis]

(The Doctor enters.)
DOCTOR: Sorry, I was busy. What's happening?

[Clara's kitchen]

CLARA: Oh, nothing. You know, same old, same old.

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Well, you're only human.

[Clara's kitchen]

DOCTOR [OC]: So what I can do for you, Clara?

[Cauldera]

(The Doctor is lying outside the Tardis as the volcano spits lava and lumps of rock. He wakes with a start to see Clara standing in the smoke by the edge of the ledge.)
DOCTOR: Clara?

[Tardis]

(Clara enters. The Doctor is working on a piece of machinery.)
CLARA: Start her up.
DOCTOR: Where are we going?
CLARA: Away.
DOCTOR: From?
CLARA: Just away.
DOCTOR: Well, normally you say work or kids or dishes or dullness. So what's happened?
(Clara goes downstairs to his workbench, takes a key from a round box and puts it in her coat pocket.)
CLARA: A volcano.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?
CLARA: I've never seen an active volcano, do you know one?
DOCTOR: What's so great about seeing a volcano? It's just a sort of leaky mountain.
CLARA: I've never seen lava.
(She takes something out of his coat pocket and puts it into hers.)
DOCTOR: It's rubbish.
CLARA: Prove it.

[Cauldera]

CLARA: It's on your neck.

[Tardis]

(In flight. Clara finds another key hidden inside The Time Traveller's Wife. Good book, interesting concept.)
CLARA: Do you still have those sleep patch things?
DOCTOR: You can't have one.
CLARA: I'm having trouble sleeping.
DOCTOR: You still can't have one.
CLARA: Can I have one?
DOCTOR: No, you can't have one.
(So Clara takes the box of them from a small set of drawers.)
DOCTOR: So, volcano. What's so good about lava?
(Clara puts one of the patches on the back of the Doctor's neck.)

[Cauldera]

(Clara is holding out her hand.)
CLARA: You told me once what it would take to destroy a Tardis key. That's what's so good about lava. All seven. From all of your hiding places.
(She holds one up.)
DOCTOR: Clara, what are you doing? Don't. Be very, very careful with that. Those are very, very
(She throws it backwards into the lava.)
CLARA: Do I have your attention?
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: Good.
DOCTOR: No. Not good, Clara.
CLARA: Danny Pink.
DOCTOR: Yeah?
CLARA: Is dead.
DOCTOR: And?
CLARA: Seriously?
DOCTOR: And?
CLARA: And fix it. Change it. Change what happened. Save him. Bring him back.
(She holds up another key and we all remember what happened in Father's Day.)
DOCTOR: No.
(She throws the key away.)
CLARA: Five left. Every time you say no to me, I will throw another key down there. Do we understand each other?
DOCTOR: Well, I understand you. Let's not get carried away.
CLARA: Time can be rewritten.
DOCTOR: With precision. With great care. And not today. But you know that of course, otherwise you wouldn't be threatening me.
CLARA: Did you just say no?
DOCTOR: If I change the events that brought you here, you will never come here and ask me to change those events. Paradox loop. The timeline disintegrates. Your timeline. And yes!
CLARA: Yes?
DOCTOR: Yes. I did just say no. Throw away the key.
CLARA: I have seen you change time, I have seen you break any rule you want.
DOCTOR: I know when I can, I know when I can't. Throw the key.
CLARA: I know what you're doing. You're trying to take control.
DOCTOR: I am in control. Throw away the key. Do as you are told.
CLARA: No!
DOCTOR: Well, either you do as you're told or stop threatening me. There really isn't a third option here.
CLARA: Do you know what, Doctor? When it comes to taking control, you really are out of your depth.
(She throws all the remaining keys bar one into the lava.)
CLARA: One last chance. And I don't care about the rules, I don't give a damn about paradoxes. Save Danny. Bring him back or I swear you will never step inside your Tardis again.
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: Do as you are told.
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: Say it again so I know you mean it.
DOCTOR: No!
CLARA: I'm not kidding, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Neither am I.
CLARA: I will do it!
DOCTOR: Clara, my Clara, I don't think you will!
(The last key goes into the lava.)
CLARA: Oh, I'd say I'm sorry but I'd do it again.
(Clara falls to her knees and cries.)
CLARA: I'd do it again. Well, what are you doing? Why are you just standing there? Do you understand what I have just done?
DOCTOR: Look in your hand.
CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.
DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand.
CLARA: The keys, they're gone. They're down there. They've gone.
DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand.
CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, there is. Look.
(The sleep patch is in the middle of Clara's palm.)
DOCTOR: Did you seriously think that that was going to work on me?
(And back into the Tardis, to when Clara put the patch on the Doctor's neck. He grabs her hand and neatly presses the patch into her palm instead.)
DOCTOR: They're not sleep patches. They induce a dream state.
(He removes the patch from her palm.)

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Makes you very suggestible.
(He picks up the Tardis keys from the floor.)
DOCTOR: I allowed the whole scenario to play out just as you planned. I was curious about how far you would go.
CLARA: Well, now you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Now I know.
CLARA:I love him.
(The Doctor scans her with the sonic screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite the mess of chemicals, aren't you?
CLARA: So, what now? What do we do now? You and me, what happens now? Doctor?
DOCTOR: Go to hell.
(The Tardis lands.)
CLARA: Fair enough. Absolutely fair enough.
(She walks to the door.)
DOCTOR: Clara? You asked me what we're going to do. I told you. We're going to hell. Or wherever it is people go when they die. If there is anywhere. Wherever it is, we're going to go there and we're going to find Danny. And if it is in any way possible, we're going to bring him home. Almost every culture in the universe has some concept of an afterlife. I always meant to have a look around, see if I could find one.
CLARA: You're going to help me?
DOCTOR: Well, why wouldn't I help you?
CLARA: Because of what I just did. I just
DOCTOR: You betrayed me. Betrayed my trust, you betrayed our friendship, you betrayed everything that I've ever stood for. You let me down!
CLARA: Then why are you helping me?
DOCTOR: Why? Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference? Stop it with the eyes. Don't do that with the eyes. How do you do that anyway? It's like they inflate. Cut out the whining while you're at it. We've got work to do. This is it, Clara, one of those moments.
CLARA: What moments?
DOCTOR: The darkest day. The blackest hour. Chin up, shoulders back. Let's see what we're made of, you and I. Switching off the safeguards, turning off the nav-com. Remember, we did this before. We plugged you into the Tardis telepathic interface.
CLARA: We ended up all over Danny's timestream.
DOCTOR: Because you and he are linked. Strongly linked. Your timestreams are intertwined. So if he's anywhere at all, that link will hold. Give me your hands.
CLARA: Doctor
DOCTOR: We're in a hurry.
CLARA: I don't deserve a friend like you.
DOCTOR: Clara, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm exactly what you deserve.
(He puts her hands into the orange gloop part of the console.)
DOCTOR: Think about Danny. Think about the man you lost. Let it hurt. Let it burn. But don't bleat. Don't ask, why him? Why me? Forget all that. Ask one question. Just one. Ask, where is Danny Pink now? Where is he now?
(And after a few moments, the time rotor starts up.)
DOCTOR: Well, the Tardis thinks he's somewhere.
[Seb's office]

(Danny is sitting at a desk with his head resting on his hand. It slips and he wakes. Somewhere a phone rings, and it sounds like a busy office outside. He looks around at a set of in-trays, pens in holders, and a name plate on the desk which says - Nethersphere After Death Department  SEB. The company logo is a very large circle with a small one attached at seven o'clock. The door opens.)
SEB: Has anyone offered you a coffee?
DANNY: Um.  Well, no.
SEB: Could we have some coffee along here, please? The good kind. We've got a new one.
(Seb shuts the door and sits at his desk.)
SEB: Five minutes, tops. Best to wait for the good coffee.
DANNY: Where am I?
SEB: Sometimes it's just the instant.
(Seb pulls a 'nasty taste' face.)
DANNY: Where am I?
SEB: Well, big question. Try to take that one slowly. We have been trying to contact family members, but really there is so much admin
DANNY: I wasn't here, I was
SEB: Yeah. That last thing that happened to you, that really happened, I'm afraid. But that's life. Well, not life, I suppose, but. There are some forms to fill in. Might help you relax.
Well, they won't, but we do need them filled in. Right, important thing. Need to know. Are you being cremated? Sorry, it's a fairly urgent question.
DANNY: I don't know. I've never really thought of that.
SEB: I'm going to put you down as a yes, that's pretty much the default these days. If people only knew.
DANNY: Only knew what?
(Seb rolls his chair back to the door and shouts through the wall.)
SEB: We've got a burner in number twelve. Tell them to prep, please.
DANNY: Burner?
(Seb rolls back to the deck.)
SEB: Yeah, it's fine, we'll come to that.
DANNY: But I don't understand where I am.
(Seb looks at the large pair of curtains covering one wall. Danny gets up and opens them, then gasps. He is looking out of a round window at a host of buildings which appear to be on the inside of a small Dyson Sphere.)
SEB: Oh, look at that. You can see my house from here. Yeah, sorry, probably not helping.
DANNY: Where am I? Er.
SEB:  You sort of know, don't you? Most people kind of know, it's just hard to get traction on the concept.
DANNY: Where am I?
SEB: Okay. You're dead, and this is what's next.
DANNY: I'm not dead. How can I be dead?
SEB: Our sincere condolences.
DANNY: I'm standing right here.
SEB: Yes, you are. Welcome to the Underworld. Otherwise known as the Nethersphere, or the Promised Land. It's where you go when you die.
(Danny starts to hyperventilate.)
SEB: Would you like to breathe into a bag?

[Tardis]

(The Tardis materialises.)
CLARA: Where are we?
DOCTOR: Nav-com's offline. We'll have to do this old school.
CLARA: But this is where Danny is?
DOCTOR: Almost certainly not. It's where there's a connection with Danny. According to the Tardis, this is where it's most likely that your timeline will re-intersect with his. And that won't do.
CLARA: What won't?
DOCTOR: You won't. Look at you. I need sceptical, clever, critical. I don't need mopey. It put years on your face. And what if people see us together? It looks like you've been melted.
CLARA: Are you forgetting why we're here?
DOCTOR: We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead, so buck up and give me some attitude.

[Entrance lobby]

(The Tardis has parked herself between two of four columns at the bottom of a set of steps leading up to a large urn on a plinth, which has an eternal flame burning in it. The place is dark, and the Doctor shines a torch on an small obelisk with the Company logo on it in gold and the words Rest In Peace, We Promise carved into the granite. They look up at ranks and ranks of glass fronted cubicles on three sides of this marble edifice. There is the sound of water nearby.)
CLARA: Fish tanks?
DOCTOR: In a mausoleum?
(They go up the steps to the urn. Its plinth also has the logo and motto on it.)
CLARA: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It means those are definitely not fish tanks.
(They turn right at the urn and enter - )

[Gallery]

(Lined on the right hand side with floor to ceiling tanks. Each contains a skeleton sitting on a chair.)
CLARA: Why?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
CLARA: Okay, I'm assuming they didn't actually drown in there.
DOCTOR: No. They were placed, after death. These are tombs. Water tombs, some sort of fluid, anyway.
CLARA: With chairs?
DOCTOR: With chairs, yes. Extra comfort for the deceased. It pays to die rich.
(There is a name under each tank. Clara looks at Xylo Jones then moves on.)
CLARA: Oh, God. Am I going to find Danny now? Is that why the Tardis brought us here? I don't want to see him like that.
DOCTOR: Good point. Tombs with windows. Who wants to watch their loved ones rot? Why would anyone go to so much trouble just to keep watch on the dead?
(As they walk on, a skeleton turns its head to watch them. The Doctor finds a small book on a lecturn. He opens his fingers across a blank page and a cube rises up out of it. He pushes it into the corridor and opens it. It displays that two ring logo with 3W inside it while Bach's Air on a G String plays softly. A voice speaks the words that then scroll down.)
MISSY [OC]: 3W. Death is not an end. But we can we help with that. Ever since 3W encountered the truth about the death experience, 'we have been working hard to find a better life for the deceased. At 3W, afterlife means aftercare.
CLARA: Okay. Bit strange?
DOCTOR: Very. Why have the scrolling and a voice? Is it difficult?
CLARA: Is what difficult?
DOCTOR: Reading all those words back to front. Come on. We've come a long way.
(Missy walks through the logo, which disappears.)
MISSY: Hello. I hope you're well. How may I assist you with your death?
DOCTOR: Well, there is, er, no immediate hurry. We're just, er. We're just
CLARA: Browsing.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, browsing.
MISSY: Please, take all the time you need. At 3W, you always have the rest of your life.
DOCTOR: Oh, good. That's good to know, Clara, isn't it?
CLARA: Yeah. Great.
DOCTOR: Exactly what is 3W?
MISSY: Apologies. Clearly you have not received the official 3W greetings package.
DOCTOR: Well, you know, it's just an unexpected
(Missy lunges at the Doctor, pushing him against the wall then kissing him very intently. The Doctor's eyes bulge and he grabs the wall. Missy finishes by kissing the tip of his nose three times, then she steps back.)
MISSY: Welcome to the 3W Institute.
DOCTOR: (breathless) Clara, is it over now?
CLARA: I think it's over, yeah.
MISSY: You also have not received the official welcome package.
CLARA: Oh, I'm good, thanks. No worries.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
MISSY: I am Missy.
CLARA: Missy?
MISSY: Mobile Intelligent Systems Interface. I am a multi-function, interactive welcome-droid. Helping you to help me to help you.
DOCTOR: You're very er realistic.
CLARA: Tongues?
DOCTOR: Shut up.
MISSY: I am fully programmed with social interaction norms appropriate to a range of visitors. Please indicate if you'd like me to adjust my intimacy setting.
(The Doctor peels himself off the wall.)
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, please. Please do that. Do that now right now.
CLARA: Maybe just a tad, yeah.
DOCTOR: I need to speak to whoever's in charge here.
MISSY: (as Maggie Smith) I am in charge.
DOCTOR: Well, who's in charge of you?
MISSY: I'm in charge of me.
DOCTOR: Well, who repairs you? Who, who maintains you?
MISSY: I am programmed for self-repair. I am maintained by my heart.
(Missy takes the Doctor's hand and places it on her bosom.)
MISSY: Is everything in order?
DOCTOR: Who maintains your heart?
MISSY: My heart is maintained by the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Doctor who?
MISSY: (shouts) Doctor Chang!
(Missy walks away from the Doctor, who doesn't move his hand.)
CHANG [OC]: Who's there?
CHANG: Hello?
CLARA: Hello.
DOCTOR: Hello.
CLARA: You can probably take your hand down now, Doctor.
CHANG: So. Hey. Condolences.
CLARA: Condolences?
CHANG: It's a mausoleum. It's our hello. Is there a particular dead person you want to talk to?
CLARA: Yes. Yes, there is.
CHANG: This way then.
DOCTOR: Are you okay?
CLARA: No.
(He takes her hand.)
DOCTOR: Good. There would be something very wrong if you were.
(All the skeletons turn their heads to watch them leave. Missy smiles, then looks up at a red spotted globe turning up in the corner.)

[Balcony]

(Seb opens the doors and lets Danny go first into the night air with emergency vehicle sirens wailing in the distance.)
SEB: Bit of fresh air. Do you good.
DANNY: Why's it so cold here?
SEB: And the Wi-Fi is better out here. Don't know why.
DANNY: Wi-Fi?
SEB: Yeah, still a bit spotty, but basically
DANNY: You have Wi-Fi here?
(Seb is calling something up on his tablet computer.)
DANNY: You. You have iPads in the afterlife?
SEB: IPads? We have Steve Jobs. Listen, another big question for you. Have you ever killed anybody?
DANNY: This is surreal.
SEB: Imagine embryos had telephones.
DANNY: That's really not helping.
SEB: Go with me. Go with me. Imagine babies in wombs could talk to other babies in other wombs. What would they say? What would they think life was like if they could talk among themselves?
DANNY: I really have no idea.
SEB: They'd think that life was nine months long. Then, boom, trap door opens, out you fall, gone for ever. Never hear from those guys again. Nothing at the end of the cord.
DANNY: Okay.
SEB: This isn't really an afterlife. It's just more life than you were expecting.
DANNY: Why did you ask me if I'd killed anyone?
SEB: Before you were a teacher, you spent some time as a soldier.
DANNY: Yeah, so?
SEB: Any regrets? Bad memories?
DANNY: Is that, is that any of your business?
SEB: Yes.

[Memories]

(In either Iraq or Afghanistan, Danny and his troop are returning fire in a village.)
SOLDIER: Get to cover, now!

[Balcony]

SEB: Sorry if I triggered something then. Memory flashes can be very impactful in the early stages.
DANNY: Why?
SEB: Why what?
(Danny recalls taking a grenade from his pouch and throwing it into the remains of a building.)
DANNY: Why is it any of your business?
SEB: We've had a request to meet you. Any idea who that would be from?
(Danny recalls bursting into a building and immediately opening fire.)
SEB: It's been given a priority, which usually means
DANNY: Means what?
(Danny has shot someone.)
SEB: Well, anyway, we've arranged a meet-up.
DANNY: When?
SEB: Come in.
(Danny sees the person from his memories. A young boy in a football shirt is peering around the door.)
SOLDIER [OC]: Danny, repeat, is the building secure?'
SEB: So, I guess you remember him, yeah?
SOLDIER [OC]: Danny? Danny!

[Chang's office]

CHANG: Come in, come in. Going to need to take a reading off you.
(There is one of those big tanks in here, too. The Doctor goes to take a look around.)
CLARA: A reading?
CHANG: Won't hurt.
(He flicks a switch.)
CLARA: What won't?
DOCTOR: How does the body keep its integrity? Why isn't it just a bunch of bones floating about?
CHANG: Each body is encased in a support exoskeleton. 

[Gallery]

CLARA [OC]: An invisible exoskeleton?
CHANG: It's only invisible in the water. There's a specially engineered refraction index in the fluid so we can see the tank resident unimpeded by the support mechanisms.
(Missy is listening to the conversation.)
DOCTOR [OC]: So each skeleton is inside something?
(She puts her hand on a tank and a skeletal hand reaches out.)

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Are you serious? X-ray water?
CHANG: It's so cool. Look at this. We call it dark water.
(He puts his arm into a sample jar of it. His wrist watch and jacket sleeve vanish.)
CHANG: Only organic matter can be seen through it.
(He removes his arm and dries it off.)
CHANG: I keep saying they should use this stuff in swimming pools.
DOCTOR: Why?
CHANG: Think about it.
DOCTOR: I am thinking about it. Why?
CLARA: Doesn't matter. 3W, what kind of name is that? What does it mean?
(The skeleton in the tank behind them turns its head.)
CHANG: Well, you know, don't you? You're here on business or they wouldn't have let you in. Sorry. Should have checked. Who are you?
DOCTOR: I thought that you would never ask. Sort out your security protocols, they're a disgrace.
(He gets out the psychc paper.)
CHANG: Another government inspection? So soon? Why is there all this swearing?
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got a lot of internalised anger. What does 3W stand for?
CHANG: Well, the three words.
CLARA: What three words?
CHANG: Seriously? You don't know?
DOCTOR: Never mind what we know and what we don't know, just answer our question.
CHANG: Because people who don't know, when they hear about this, they can freak out.
DOCTOR: We're not going to freak out.
CHANG: If you've had a recent loss, this might be, this will be disturbing.
DOCTOR: She'll be fine.
CLARA: Speak for me again, I'll detach something from you. I'll be fine.
CHANG: You know how people are scared of dying? Like, everybody.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's the most fundamental fear in the universe.
CHANG: They'd be a lot more scared if they knew what it was really like.
(Chang activates the see through computer screen on his desk.)

[Balcony]

(Danny is sitting at the table opposite the young boy.)
DANNY: So. You okay? I'm sorry. I just
(Danny reaches for the boy's hand. He recoils and runs off.)
DANNY: Hey, hey. Hey, listen. Listen  Hey!
SEB: Probably best not, eh? Doesn't speak much.
DANNY: Why would he want to see me?
(A man screams in agony nearby.)
DANNY: What the hell is that?
SEB: Sounds like somebody left their body to science. Okay. Er,  It's probably time to explain why you're always feeling cold.

[Chang's office]

CHANG: White noise off the telly. We've all heard it. A few years ago, Doctor Skarosa, our founder, did something unexpected. He played that noise through a translation matrix of his own devising. This is a recording of what he heard.
(A sound wave of multiple voices.)
CLARA: Okay, people, voices.
DOCTOR: So what?
CHANG: Over time, Doctor Skarosa became convinced these were the voices of the recently departed. He believed it was a telepathic communication from the dead.
DOCTOR: Why? Was he an idiot?
CHANG: He was able to isolate some of the voices, hear what they were saying.
DOCTOR: So, an idiot then.
(Chang turns off the recording.)
CLARA: Shut up, Doctor.
CHANG: What I'm about to play you will change your life and not for the better. These are the three words which caused Doctor Skarosa to set up institutes, like this one, all over the world, to protect the dead. If you'd rather not hear these words, there's still time
DOCTOR: Can you just hurry up, please, or I'll hit you with my shoe.
VOICE [OC]: Don't cremate me. Don't cremate me!
CHANG: There is one simple, horrible possibility that has never occurred to anyone throughout human history.
VOICE [OC]: Don't cremate me. Don't cremate me!
CLARA: Don't say it.
CHANG: The dead remain conscious. The dead are fully aware of everything that is happening to them.  

[Balcony]

SEB: So your mind is here. Your soul, whatever you want to call it. And you're in your new body in your new world, but you're still connected to your old body in the old world. You're still going to feel what it feels.
DANNY: That's why I'm cold.
SEB: They're keeping you in a cold place, yeah. You did say you were being cremated?
(Seb's tablet beeps.)
SEB: Sorry, I'll get this.
DANNY: Sorry. Sorry, are you telling me
SEB: Wow! Oh, that's rare. This never happens.
DANNY: Wow, what now? What never happens?
SEB: You've got a call.
DANNY: A call.
SEB: From the other side.
DANNY: Meaning?
SEB: Do you know somebody called Clara Oswald?

[Chang's office]

DOCTOR: Fakery. All of it. It's a con, it's a racket!
CHANG: I promise you this is not a con.
CLARA: What's that beeping?

[Gallery]

DOCTOR [OC]: Never mind about beeping. Who cares about beeping? The dead are dead. 'They're not talking to you out of your television sets. They're just gone
(Missy claps her hands, and the skeletons all stand up.)
DOCTOR [OC]: And all these poor souls down there in these tanks, I'm sorry, but they're just dead and they're not coming back.

[Chang's office]

(Chang manipulates a device.)
DANNY [OC]: Clara? Clara? Clara, are you there?
CLARA: Danny! I can hear you. Is that you?

[Balcony]

CLARA [OC]: Oh, please, say it's you. 
DANNY: That's her, that's Clara!
SEB: Yeah, you're really lucky. It hardly ever happens.
(The connection is audio only on Seb's tablet, then the signal drops out.)
DANNY: Where did she go?

[Chang's office]

CHANG: Just lost the signal. But I can track it back, I'm pretty sure.
CLARA: I don't, I don't understand. What is happening?
CHANG: We've been scanning you telepathically since you came in. You said you wanted to speak to someone who'd passed, and we've found you a match in the Nethersphere.
DOCTOR: This isn't possible. The dead don't come back.
(Behind him, the skeleton in the tank stands up.)

[Balcony]

DANNY: Come on, get her back.
SEB: Da-da-da. I'm trying.

[Chang's office]

CLARA: It was him. It was his voice.
DOCTOR: If they scanned you telepathically, they could've lifted a voice print. It could still be a fake.
CHANG: Getting him back, very nearly!

[Balcony]

DANNY: Clara, can you hear me?

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Yes, Danny, I can hear you. Can you hear me?
DANNY [OC]: Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

[Balcony]

DANNY: Clara! Oh, God. Clara
CLARA [OC]: What do I do?
DANNY: Who are you talking to?

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Hang on just a moment.
DOCTOR: Question him. Ask him questions only he'd know the answer to. Be sure. You, with me.
CLARA: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: I've got to check out those tanks. There's something that I'm missing.
DANNY [OC]: 'Clara?
DOCTOR: Sceptical and critical, remember? Be strong, even if it breaks your heart.
CHANG: Connection's stabilised. It should be okay.
DOCTOR: Who would harvest dead bodies? I feel like I'm missing something obvious.
(As he walks out through the double doors with windows cut out in the shape of the logo, but symmetrical. Almost like eyes.)
CLARA: Danny?

[Balcony]

DANNY: Yeah, I'm here.

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Danny, I'm so sorry but I'm going to have to ask you some questions.
DANNY: Questions? I swear on anything it's me!

(Missy snaps her fingers.)
MISSY: Humankind, bring out your dead.
(The standing skeletons turn and press a button on the wall of their tanks, activating something. The liquid starts to drain from the tanks. The Doctor and Chang enter.)
CHANG: Oh, my God. The tanks The tanks are activating! They're not supposed to do that.
DOCTOR: And all your dead people are standing. Don't you think you skipped the headline?
MISSY: Now, now, children. Naughty, naughty.
DOCTOR: Doctor Chang, your welcome droid has developed a fault.
CHANG: That's not a droid. That's my boss.
MISSY: You know, I might have been guilty of a just teensy little fibette. Doctorr Chang, I really liked working with you. I've enjoyed every day of it.
CHANG: I'm sorry?
MISSY: You know, I've even got a little photograph of you looking so sweet. I'm always going to keep it. Always!
CHANG: Are you going to kill me?
MISSY: Now, come on. Let's not dwell on horrid things. This is going to be our last conversation, and I'm the one who's going to have to live with that.
CHANG: Please don't kill me.
MISSY: Say something nice.
CHANG: Please, please. I don't, I don't want to die. You're going to kill me, aren't you?
MISSY: Say something nice.
CHANG: Please!
MISSY: Doctor Chang, I've got all day. And I'm not going to kill you until you say something nice.
CHANG: It has been an absolute pleasure working with you, and I truly believe that you'll never be able to find it in your heart to murder me.
(Missy holds up a device that fires a heat ray, which incinerates Chang instantly. The Doctor backs away.)
MISSY: Now, I'll be with you in a moment. Just feeling a bit emotional at the moment.
(The Doctor looks up at a tank and sees the water level dropping below the top of a skeleton's head, to reveal a silver metal helmet.)
DOCTOR: Cybermen!

[Balcony]

DANNY: It's me. I, I swear on anything it's me.
CLARA [OC]: The very first restaurant you took me to. That first date. What was it called?
DANNY: Clara, it's me.

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Then what was the name of the restaurant? What was it?

[Balcony]

DANNY: I can't remember!

[Gallery]

DOCTOR: They're Cybermen, all of them. We've got to stop them getting out.
MISSY: Now who's missing the headline? The Nethersphere. You know it's ever so funny, the people that live inside that think they've gone to heaven.
(The Doctor looks up at the globe.)
CLARA [OC]: My birthday. When is it?

[Balcony]

DANNY: November twenty third. That's right, isn't it? I got that one right.
CLARA [OC]: It's pretty basic information. 'Anyone could know that. Say something only you could say.

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Tell me something only Danny would know.

[Gallery]

DOCTOR: That's a matrix data-slice. A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord technology.
MISSY: Imagine you could upload dying minds to that. Edit them. Rearrange them. Get rid of all those boring emotions. Ready to be re-downloaded. Meanwhile, you upgrade the bodies.
Upload the mind, upgrade the body. Cybermen from cyberspace. Now, why has no-one ever thought of that before?
DOCTOR: How did you get hold of Time Lord technology?  Who are you?
MISSY: You know who I am. I told you. You felt it. Surely you did.
DOCTOR: Two hearts.
MISSY: And both of them yours.
DOCTOR: You're a Time Lord.
MISSY: Time Lady, please, I'm old-fashioned.
DOCTOR: Which Time Lady?
MISSY: The one you abandoned, Doctor. The one you left for dead. Didn't you ever think I'd find my way back?
DOCTOR: Clara. Clara. Clara. I've got to get Clara!
(The Doctor runs to the lift door.)
MISSY: Oh, Clara, Clara, Clara! You know I should shoot you in a jealous rage. Now, wouldn't that be sexy? I've turned the lift off, though.
DOCTOR: I presume you have stairs.
MISSY: Well, I'm not a Dalek.
(The Doctor sonicks open the door to the stairs and runs out to -)

[Outside St Paul's Cathedral]

MISSY: Oh, dear, Doctor. Didn't you realise where you were?
(Church bells peal as the look down Ludgate Hill. A number 56 bus drives past.)

[Chang's office]

DANNY [OC]: I love you.
CLARA: No. No, no, no. I'm sorry, but no. Anybody could say that. Anybody would know to say that. Say something only you could tell me. Prove to me you are really Danny.

[Balcony]

DANNY: How?
CLARA: I love you means nothing right now.

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Not until I know who's talking. Say something only Danny could say.

[Balcony]

DANNY: Clara
CLARA [OC]: Danny, if that is you 

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Wherever you are

[Balcony]

CLARA: Whatever it takes, I will be with you again, I swear.
DANNY: No, you won't. You are not coming here.
CLARA [OC]: Nothing will stop me,

[Chang's office]

CLARA: Nothing in the world, as soon as I know it's you.
DANNY: There is only one way

[Balcony]

DANNY: To come here, and you are not doing that.
CLARA [OC]: I'll do anything, Danny, anything. Just say something only you could say.
DANNY: Clara, you have your life. You have your whole life to live. You have to stay there.
CLARA [OC]: No. I have to be with Danny Pink.
DANNY: I love you.

[Chang's offfice]

CLARA: Stop saying that! Don't say that. If you say that again, I swear I will switch this thing off.

[Balcony]

DANNY: Clara
CLARA [OC]: Yes?
DANNY: I love you.
(Clara turns off Chang's computer. Danny sits down and cries. Seb takes back the tablet and calls up another app.)
SEB: These emotions, they're terribly difficult. But, you know, we've got a thing for that. We can help with all these difficult feelings. Just press this.
(On the screen, next to the name Danny Pink, is a button marked Delete.)
SEB: I'll leave you to make a decision.

(Clara turns around to see the Cyberman who, according to the name plaque, is Dr Skarosa. She runs to the door.)
CLARA: Doctor!
(The doors to the now empty tanks swing open. Shame, I was hoping they'd smash their way out like they did from their Tomb. The Cybermen step out and stomp away.)

[St Peter's Hill]

(The Doctor runs down the steps towards the river.)
DOCTOR: Get away from here! All of you, run!
(The Cybermen stomp out of the Cathedral. Ah, memories of The Invasion.)
DOCTOR: Go! Go! Get away from here! Run away!  Run, run! Get away from here all of you, now!
MISSY: I'm sorry, everyone. Another ranting Scotsman in the street. I had no idea there was a match on.
DOCTOR: Get away, go!
MISSY: Stop shouting, love. Stop making a fuss. It's too late. All the graves of planet Earth are about to give birth. You know the key strategic weakness of the human race? The dead outnumber the living.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
MISSY: Oh, you know who I am. I'm Missy.
DOCTOR: Who's Missy?
MISSY: Please, try to keep up. Short for Mistress. Well, I couldn't very well keep calling myself the Master, now could I?
(The Doctor backs away, horrified. The Cybermen continue their march. Danny sobs then pulls his finger away from the Delete button.)

To Be Continued...


Previously
CLARA: Danny Pink is dead.
DOCTOR: We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead. Those are tombs. Water tombs. Why would anyone go to so much trouble?
SEB: You're dead and, and this is what's next.
DOCTOR: A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord technology.
MISSY: Do you know the key strategic weakness of the human race? The dead outnumber the living.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
MISSY: Oh, you know who I am. I'm Missy. I couldn't very well keep calling myself The Master, now could I?

(Cyber Dr Skarosa stomps out of his cubicle, stops by his desk and turns, pointing his weapon at Clara, who was hiding behind it.)
CLARA: Stop! You can't kill me.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Incorrect.
CLARA: I'm a target of strategic value. Alive, I'm a tactical advantage. Dead, I'm your biggest mistake.You don't know who I am.
(Cyber-Skarosa scans her with his chest disc.)
CYBER-SKAROSA: You are Clara Oswald. You are human. You are unimportant.
CLARA: Incorrect. You see, That is what you're supposed to think. That is what everybody thinks.
CYBER-SKAROSA: You are Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Clara Oswald is a cover story, a disguise. There is no Clara Oswald.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Identify.
CLARA: Oh, don't be so slow, it's embarrassing. Who could fool you like this? Who could hide right under your nose? Who could change their face any time they want? Hmm. You see, I'm not Clara Oswald. Clara Oswald has never existed.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Identify.
CLARA: I'm the Doctor.
(And just to try and convince us, they put Jenna's name first and her eyes in the opening titles instead of Peter's.)

[St Peters Hill]

MISSY: Look at them! My boys.
DOCTOR: Cybermen in broad daylight? You think people won't notice?
(They notice, and out come the smart phones to take the photographs. Missy unpins her hat and puts it on the ground at a Cyberman's feet.)
MISSY: Photos with the big metal men, one pound.
(Several coins are thrown into her hat.)
MISSY: Oh, honey!
(One teenage lad takes a selfie of himself, a Cyberman and his girlfriend.)
BOY: There you go.
GIRL Oh, cool. Cool!
(Suddenly the location changes to Cardiff, between The Friary and Queen Street. You can tell because the steps have vanished and a Travelodge and shopping area have appeared, with Live Lounge on the corner.)
MISSY: New York. Paris. Rome. Marrakesh. Brisbane. Glasgow. Everywhere. Anywhere. Me and my boys. We're going viral.
(Missy shows him on her steampunk style smart phone.)
OSGOOD: Would you like me to take a picture? Sorry, selfies are never as good, are they? And you're having a lovely moment. Hang on!
(Osgood snatches Missy's 'phone'. The Doctor grabs Missy's arm.)
MISSY: No, just
DOCTOR: Nice bow tie.
OSGOOD: Bow ties are cool. Big smiles, and now!
(Weapons are taken from pushchairs and backpacks. Soldiers come out of the buildings on both sides.)
SOLDIERS: Move, move, move! Stand by. Surround target. Hold back!
(Once the scene is secure, a blonde woman walks up holding something behind her back.)
KATE: Afternoon. You've picked a lovely day for it. My, don't you look shiny. (to the Doctor) Haircut?
DOCTOR: Bit of a trim.
KATE: Might want to do your roots. The woman.
SOLDIER: Yes, ma'am.
(Missy is held by two soldiers. Kate Lethbridge Stewart addresses the serried ranks of Cybermen.)
KATE: Kate Stewart. Divorcee, mother of two, keen gardener, outstanding bridge player. Also Chief Scientific Officer, Unified Intelligence Taskforce, who currently have you surrounded.
CYBERMAN: Human weaponry is not effective against Cyber technology.
KATE: Sorry, you left this behind on one of your previous attempts.
(She throws down a battered Mondas Cyberman head. A soldier brings the Doctor forward to stand next to her.)
KATE: So now that I have your attention, welcome to the only planet in the universe where we get to say this. He's on the payroll.
DOCTOR: Am I?
KATE: Well, technically.
DOCTOR: How much?
KATE: Shush. Any questions?
(As one, the Cybermen thump the blue disc in the middle of their chests and stamp their feet on the ground. Dust is blown everywhere as little engines in their feet start up. Missy smiles.)
SOLDIER: Back, back, everyone, back!
(The Cybermen zoom up into the air, and out of sight. Osgood turns around to see the lead covering of the dome of St Pauls peeling back like a Chocolate Orange.)
OSGOOD: Oh, my God! Is it supposed to do that? Is that new?
DOCTOR: A sun roof on Saint Paul's? Yes, I'd say that was new.
KATE: There's going to be mass panic. Everyone in London can see that.
(More Cybermen fly out of the dome.)
DOCTOR: Everyone in London just clapped and went whee. Hush, I'm trying to count.
OSGOOD: Eighty seven, I think. OCD.
MISSY: Ninety one. Queen of evil.
KATE: How could Saint Paul's be full of ninety one Cybermen and nobody noticed?
DOCTOR: Dimensional engineering. One space folded inside another. Bigger on the inside. Easy if you're a Time Lord.
OSGOOD: Mostly deploying south, a smaller number east.
DOCTOR: Yep, but one straight up.
OSGOOD: So ninety one isn't a coincidence?
DOCTOR: Of course it isn't.
(He takes Missy's 'phone' from Osgood.)
KATE: Osgood? Ninety one. Explain.
OSGOOD: Ninety one areas of significant population density in the British Isles.
DOCTOR: That's one Cyberman for every city and major town. It's happening everywhere, all over the world, right now.
MISSY: Sweet planet, this. I think I might keep it.
KATE: One Cyberman per city. What could they hope to accomplish?
OSGOOD: Doctor!
(The Cyberman that flew straight up has detonated itself.)
KATE: Has it exploded?
MISSY: More than that. Cybermen don't just blow themselves up for no good reason, dear. They're not human.
DOCTOR: If it's not exploding, what's it doing?
MISSY: Pollinating. Falling like rain into the cracks of the Earth.

[Balcony]

(The Gallifreyan hard drive goes dark. In the Nethersphere, the lights are starting to go out. Seb joins Danny and the Iraqi/Afghani boy.)
SEB: Well, this is a bit exciting!
DANNY: What's happening?
SEB: Well, to cut a long story short, it looks like we might all be going home.
DANNY: Home? From the afterlife?
SEB: Well, when I said afterlife, I was being a tiny bit poetic. And Nethersphere's just a cool name we come up with during a spit-ball.
DANNY: What is this place?
SEB: Well, you have to think of it as a data cloud. You know, for storing data. In this case, it's the storage of recently deceased minds.
DANNY: We're in a cloud?
SEB: A sort of cloud, yeah.
DANNY: And what's happening to it?
SEB: What happens to any cloud when it starts to rain.
DANNY: Are you telling me we're going back? What, back to our bodies?
SEB: And the extra good news is, there's been a bit of an upgrade.

[St Peters Hill]

MISSY: The dead are coming home, Doctor. All shiny and new. In twenty four hours the human race as you know it will cease to exist.
DOCTOR: What are you doing? Explain. Tell me now.
(A soldier fires a dart into Missy's neck and she crumples at the knees.)
MISSY: Oh! That was nice. Must do it again.
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, I need to talk to her! I need her awake.
(The Doctor gets sedated too, but he manages to remove the dart before collapsing. Two soldiers gently lower him to the ground.)
DOCTOR: Argh! No. No, no. Stupid. Stupid! No, no. Argh!
(Osgood kneels over the Doctor. Kate phones in the situation.)
KATE: The first protocol is implemented. We're good to go.
OSGOOD: You just have to let it take you.
(The Doctor pulls her close and whispers in her ear before finally passing out.)
KATE: What did he say?
OSGOOD: He said, guard the graveyards.

[Cemetery]

(Thunder crashes in the black Cyber-cloud hanging over a very neat walled Cemetery. The gates are shut to keep the public out.)
TEENAGE BOY: That's weird. Look at that.
(Rain pours down on the graves and mausoleums.
TEENAGE BOY: How come it's only raining inside the graveyard?

[Chaplet Funeral Home]

(At 21 Wardour Row, in a nod to Dorothea 'Dodo' Chaplet, whom the First Doctor left in Fitzroy Square back in 1966. Water runs down the gutters and rises up from the drains.
Down in the preparation room, an undertaker is watching the television.)
NEWS REPORT: We are being told that these metal men are known as Cybermen, but unlike the accounts we have on file, they now have the ability to fly. Similar reports are coming in from all over the world. Flying Cybermen are here on a global scale. Ministers are telling us
(The man gets down from his high stool and stands in water which is covering the tiled floor. He looks up but the sprinkler system isn't leaking.)
NEWS REPORT: To remain calm. 'These Cybermen don't seem to be attacking us, at least not in any conventional fashion. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing them flying into the sky 
(A drop of water runs up the wall, then something bangs inside one of the refrigeration drawers, and another, as if the recently departed want to get out.)
GRAHAM: Hello? Hello?
(One of the bodies covered by a sheet on a preparation table sits up. A blue light glows through the cloth. It is pulled off, and Graham runs from the Cyberman. It stands, sees its reflection, and stares, then touches its face in wonderment. Finally it goes to the clipboard Graham has left on the desk and rips off the top page, which has Known As Danny Pink written in the corner.)

[Airplane hangar]

(The Tardis is being hoisted into the air to be loaded onto a jet aircraft.) 
MAN: Right. Be careful with it. Be careful. Take your time.
(The Doctor is leaning back on a box trolley with his hands cuffed behind his back. A man gives him another injection. He wakes with a start and stands.)
DOCTOR: Kate? What's with the handcuffs?
KATE: I'm sorry. In the event of an alien incursion on this scale, protocols are in place. Your co-operation is to be ensured and your unreliability assumed. You have a history.
DOCTOR: You don't have a future without me. Do you think your father would've done this?
KATE: We both know he absolutely would.
(Still unconscious Missy is wheeled in on her box trolley.)
KATE: Who is she?
DOCTOR: Long story. Where's Clara?
KATE: Clara Oswald, your assistant?
DOCTOR: My friend. She was with me in Saint Paul's.
KATE: The team's still on site but they've been unable to gain access to the building.
DOCTOR: I want her found and brought here. I need her with me.
KATE: Then give the order. As soon as you're on board Boat One your word is law. Quite literally.
(They go up the steps with the UNIT logo on them to the airplane. The Doctor stops halfway and looks around.)
DOCTOR: You got the Tardis out, though?
KATE: Yes, and Saint Paul's locked down.

[Main cabin]

(Long conference table, chairs, monitors etc.)
DOCTOR: Where are we going? Cloudbase?
KATE: You mean the Valiant?
OSGOOD: Cloudbase was Thunderbirds.
KATE: Too conspicuous. We need your location concealed, not advertised. From now on you're a moving target.
(The Doctor looks at a portrait of Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart on the bulkhead.)
DOCTOR: Ah, I see you're bringing Daddy along, too. That's very sweet.
(An Indian Army officer salutes the Doctor.)
AHMED: Sir.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't do that. You look like you're self-concussing, which would explain all of military history, now I think about it.
AHMED: Colonel Ahmed, sir. Privileged to meet you.
DOCTOR: Love your outfit, Colonel Ahmed. Are you in the Scouts? Are you a Man Scout? I didn't know they had those.
(The Doctor walks away to get a hot drink from the sideboard. Osgood walks past Ahmed.)
AHMED: It was Captain Scarlet.
OSGOOD: Sorry?
AHMED: Not Thunderbirds.
OSGOOD: Oh God, so it was,
DOCTOR: My confidence is growing every minute.
(Kate informs the cockpit of their status.)
KATE: The President is on board.
DOCTOR: Mind you, me and Sylvia Anderson, you've never seen a foxtrot like it. Hang on a second. The President? We don't want Americans bobbing around the place. They'll only start praying.
AHMED: Not the President of America, sir. The President of Earth.
(The Doctor sits at the head of the table and puts a large quantity of sugar lumps into his cup of frothy coffee.)
DOCTOR: There isn't one.
AHMED: There is now.
KATE: The incursion protocols have been agreed internationally. In the event of full-scale invasion, an Earth President is inducted immediately, with complete authority over every nation state. There was only one practical candidate.
DOCTOR: That's your answer for everything, isn't it? Vote for an idiot.
KATE: If you say so, Mister President. So long as you're on this plane, you're the Commander in Chief of every army on Earth. Every world leader is currently awaiting your instructions. You are the Chief Executive Officer of the human race. Any questions?
CAPTAIN [OC]: This is your captain speaking. Please prepare for take-off.
(The Doctor looks around, jaw dragging on the floor.)

(Clara is confronted by three Cybermen.)
CLARA: Well, gentlemen. Where to start? I was born on the planet Gallifrey, in the constellation of Kasterborous. I'm a Time Lord, but my Prydonian privileges were revoked when I stole a time capsule and ran away. Currently pilot a Type 40 Tardis. I've been married four times, all deceased. My children and grandchildren are missing, and I assume, dead. I have a non-Gallifreyan daughter created via genetic transfer. How much more do you need? I'm the Doctor.
CYBER-SKAROSA: This information is not proof. We require proof.
CLARA: How about my name?
CYBER-SKAROSA: Explain.
CLARA: Well, my name isn't Doctor, is it? I don't even really have a doctorate. Well, Glasgow University, but then I accidentally graduated in the wrong century, so technically
CYBER-SKAROSA: This information cannot be confirmed.
(Another Cyberman walks up behind Clara.)
CYBERMAN: You are Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Ah, no. I'm not!
CYBERMAN: Your deception is intended to prolong your life.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Your presence has not been ordered.
CYBERMAN: Correct. You are Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Oh, seriously, this is getting old. Look, there is no Clara Oswald. I invented her. I made her up.
CYBERMAN: Born 23rd November, 1986.
CLARA: Yeah, I chose that date. Always liked it.
CYBERMAN: Father, David James Oswald. Mother, Elena Alison Oswald.
CLARA: Stories. Stories. Stories. I made them up. Look, ask anybody who knows me. I am an incredible liar.
(The Cyberman lowers his head to look her in the eyes.)
CYBERMAN: Correct.
(He knocks her out with a zap from his right hand.)
CYBER-SKAROSA: No order was given.
CYBERMAN: Correct.
CYBER-SKAROSA: You are not under Cyber control.
(The Cyberman blasts Skarosa and the other two into pieces.)
CYBERMAN: Correct.
(We are given a view of a piece of paper in the Cyberman's left hand, with Known As Danny Pink written on it.)

[Cargo hold]

(Converted into Osgood's laboratory. Missy wakes up on her box trolley, next to the Tardis. There are two soldiers behind her. Osgood is working a little way away.)
DOCTOR: Why are you still alive?
MISSY: You saved me.
DOCTOR: I saved Gallifrey.
MISSY: Yes, Gallifrey too, I suppose. There's always collateral damage with you and me. It's our Paris.
DOCTOR: Gallifrey's lost in another dimension.
MISSY: Yes and no.
DOCTOR: Meaning?
MISSY: Yes, it's in another dimension. No, it's not lost.
DOCTOR: You know where it is?
MISSY: Yep! You know the best part about knowing? (sotto) Not telling you.
AHMED [OC]: Mister President, sir, we're ready for you up here.
DOCTOR: Remember all those years when all you wanted to do was to rule the world? On my way.
AHMED [OC]: Thank you, Mister President.
DOCTOR: Piece of cake.
(He goes to see what Osgood is working on.)
OSGOOD: Oh, er, it's her little device thingy. I thought there might be useful information on it. Who is she?
DOCTOR: You'd never believe me if I told you.
OSGOOD: Cos I thought she might be the Master, regenerated into female form? Your childhood friend, responsible for a number of previous incursions.
DOCTOR: That was fairly quick.
OSGOOD: We do have files on all our ex-prime ministers. She wasn't even the worst. Doctor, there's something nobody's talking about.
DOCTOR: Which is?
OSGOOD: The clouds caused by the exploding Cybermen, they haven't dispersed. They're still there. In fact, they've expanded and are covering almost all the land masses. We're all looking at the graveyards. Maybe we should be looking up? What do you think?
DOCTOR: All of time and space?
OSGOOD: Sorry?
DOCTOR: Just something for your bucket list.
(Osgood takes a breath from her asthma inhaler and her eyes sparkle. Meanwhile, Missy is picking her handcuffs.)

[Main cabin]

NEWS REPORT: Localised rain in the cemeteries has resulted in what can only be described as disturbances to the soil. Extraordinary eyewitness accounts are claiming that silver creatures are climbing from the graves.
(Other people, both military and civilian, are also at this briefing.)
KATE: These scenes are being repeated everywhere. Every cemetery, every mortuary, every funeral home, every hospital, the dead are returning to life as Cybermen.
NEWS REPORT: The public are being advised to stay away from all cemeteries.

[Graveyard]

(Clara wakes amongst old headstones, and stands as thunder rumbles overhead. She puts on her coat and walks past graves where the gravel covering is starting to move, pushed from below.)
CLARA: Hello? Hello?
(An urn topples over as a hand is pushed out of the ground. Someone who died in 1748 reaches up to their headstone.)

[Main cabin]

KATE: We've done heat scans of some of the cemeteries and, in each case only a handful of Cybermen have so far emerged. But every individual burial site is active.
AHMED: Active?
DOCTOR: Hatching.
KATE: More are coming. Potentially millions.
AHMED: So the rain caused all that in just a few hours?
DOCTOR: It wasn't rain, Man Scout. It was pollen. Cyber-pollen. Every tiny particle of a Cyberman contains the plans to make another Cyberman. All it has to do is to make a contact with compatible living organic matter and bang! Full conversion. But if they have learned how to convert the dead.
(He looks at the monitor showing Missy down in the Cargo Hold.)
DOCTOR: That's what she was doing. That's what 3W was for. She creates an all-new paranoia among the super-rich about dying. She exploits the wealth and the mortal remains of selected idiots so she can create a whole new race of Cybermen. Cybermen who can recruit corpses. Throw away your guns, Man Scout, it's all over. How can you win a war against an enemy that can weaponise the dead?
(Clara backs away from a Cyberman that is forcing its way out from underneath its monument. Then she sees all the others rising from their graves and stepping out of their mausoleums.)
AHMED: They're not attacking, apart from isolated incidents. They're just wandering about.
DOCTOR: They're newborns. Give them time. Why were you there this morning? Why were you already attacking?
KATE: Been investigating 3W for a while, then we got a tip-off.
AHMED: From a woman with a Scottish accent.
DOCTOR: Can't play to the gallery unless there's a gallery, and here I am.
(Missy sticks her tongue out.)
DOCTOR: Dead bodies don't have minds, of course, but she's been upgrading dying minds to a hard drive for a long time. So she upgrades the hardware, and then she updates the software.
KATE: What do you mean, a long time? How long?
DOCTOR: Well, she must have a Tardis somewhere, so as long as she likes. The past, the future 
KATE: How long, Doctor?
DOCTOR: How long has the human race had a concept of an afterlife? Turns out the afterlife is real, and it's emptying. Every graveyard on planet Earth is about to burst its banks.

(As Boat One flies above the clouds, Missy sings her own version of Mickey by Toni Basil.)
MISSY: (sings) Hey, Missy, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey, Missy. Hey. (speaks.) Excuse me. Hi. Can I tell you something really important?
OSGOOD: What.
MISSY: (sotto) I have to whisper it. It's, like, so important to everyone on this plane. You'll get in trouble if you don't listen.
OSGOOD: Right. If it was that important, why would you tell us?
MISSY: Well, look at me, I'm bananas. (sotto) Come on. Just a wee bit closer. Just a little closer. (normal) You know, the Doctor will be really impressed if you learn my secret. You can come a bit closer than that. Come on, stop mucking about. Don't be shy. You don't smell half as bad as you think you do.
OSGOOD: There are two armed men directly behind you.
MISSY: (sotto) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OSGOOD: If you've got something to say, just say it.
MISSY: Ahem.
(Osgood leans in to listen.)
MISSY: (sotto) I'm going to kill you in a minute. I'm not even kidding. You're going to be as dead as a fish on a slab any second now, all floppy and making smells. But don't tell the boys. This is our secret girl plan.
OSGOOD: Why would you bother killing me? I'm not even important.
MISSY: Oh, silly. Why does one pop a balloon? Because you're pretty. You should have a bit more confidence in yourself.
OSGOOD: Okay. Sorry, I've got work to do.
MISSY: All right, fine. You get on. You get that finished. Would a countdown help you focus at all?
OSGOOD: No, that's okay.
MISSY: Ten. Don't be scared yet, cos I'm still in double figures.
OSGOOD: I'm not scared.
MISSY: Nine. Well, no, of course you're not, cos you know you're dying anyway. Eight. Human beings are born dying.Your life spans are hilarious.
OSGOOD: Please be quiet.
MISSY: Seven. You know from the minute you slop out, you're rotting, decaying. The stench of you. Phew. I'm never going to get this place clean. Three.
OSGOOD: Three?
MISSY: I'm accelerating for dramatic effect. Oh! What's that in your pocket?
OSGOOD: There's nothing in my pocket
(Osgood reaches into her lab coat pocket and pulls out a pair of handcuffs.)
MISSY: Oh my giddy aunt. The quiet ones are the worst.
OSGOOD: Well, those aren't mine.
MISSY: Hmm.
(Missy applies red lipstick.)
MISSY: Then they must be mine.
(In the blink of an eye, she has her arm around Osgood's throat, grabbed her thingy from the desk and vaporised the two soldiers.)
MISSY: Say something nice.
OSGOOD: Missy, the Master, whatever you call yourself, I promise, I'm much more useful to you alive.
MISSY: Oh, yeah, that's true. That's definitely true. That is a good point well made. I'm proud of you, sister. But did I mention bananas! Pop.
(Missy vaporises Osgood.)
MISSY: Ah. Thanks for being yummy.
(She steps on Osgood's spectacles, crushing the lenses. Then she uses her bracelet to make the airplane start swerving.)
MISSY: Whoo-oo!

[Main cabin]

KATE: Mister President, you need to get back in your seat.
DOCTOR: I don't like being the president. People keep saluting. I'm never going to salute back.
(The Doctor inhales the fragrance of a lily he has taken from a vase in front of the Brigadier's portrait.)
KATE: Do you know, that was always my dad's big ambition, to get you to salute him just once.
DOCTOR: He should've asked.
KATE: Doctor, what are you looking at?
DOCTOR: The clouds. Still there. So what else have they got?
(A silver face appears at the porthole. 11 Oct 1963 - Nightmare at 20,000 feet Twilight Zone episode starring William Shatner, anyone?)
KATE: Oh, dear Lord!
DOCTOR: There's a Cyberman out there on the fuselage. But on the plus side, it's not turbulence.
(Then he looks at the monitor showing the laboratory.)
DOCTOR: She's out. Who let her out?
AHMED: What's it doing? Where did it go? What can one Cyberman do to a plane?
(It is not just one Cyberman.)

[Cargo hold]

(The Doctor slides down the ladder and discovers Osgood's broken spectacles. Missy comes out from behind the Tardis.)
MISSY: Oh, she was really scared. It's classic. Have you got any more friends I can play with?

[Graveyard]

(Clara picks her way past bewildered newly-risen Cybermen.)
CYBERMEN: Locate hive. Locate hive. Locate hive. Locate hive.  
(She sees one looking straight at her. It's chest disc is dark. Then it turns its back on her. She runs over.)
CLARA: Are you the one that brought me here?
CYBERMAN: Affirmative.
CLARA: So you know who I am, right?
(It turns to face her.)
CYBERMAN: You are not the Doctor.
CLARA: Of course I'm not the Doctor. I was lying to stay alive. But how do I know so much about him?
(The Cyberman is still clutching the piece of paper.)
CYBERMAN: You are his associate.
CLARA: No, I'm not. I'm not his associate. I'm his best friend. Right now, his best friend, anywhere in the universe. Have you got any sort of Cyber-Internet in there because, really, you should look it up. Look up what happens to you if you harm me.
CYBERMAN: Where is the Doctor?
CLARA: What, you think I would give up the Doctor? Don't be daft. I would never, ever, give up the Doctor, because he is my best friend, too. He is the closest person to me in this whole world. He is the man I will always forgive, always trust. The one man I would never, ever lie to.
(The Cyberman points its weapon at her, but its hand shakes so it lowers it and removes its face plate. No surprises for us, just for Clara.)
CLARA: Danny?
(He drops the screwed up paper from the funeral home.)
CYBER-DANNY: Danny Pink is dead. Help me.
CLARA: Oh, my God. Danny
CYBER-DANNY: Help me.
CLARA: Danny, I am so sorry.
CYBER-DANNY: Help me. I need you to do something for me. I can't do it myself.
(He takes the cover off his chest disc.)
CLARA: What is that?
CYBER-DANNY: It's an inhibitor. It's not activated. I need you to switch it on.
CLARA: What does it inhibit?
CYBER-DANNY: Emotion. It deletes emotions. Please. I don't want to feel like this.

[Main cabin]

AHMED: There's more than one.
KATE: What?
AHMED: They're all over the plane. They're pulling it apart!

[Cargo hold]

(Missy is enjoying the rough ride.)
MISSY: Oh, oooh. Ask me.
DOCTOR: Shut up!
MISSY: Ask me! Come on, you know you want to. You want to know what my plan is. You'll be surprised. I've got a gift for you. You know, I've been up and down your timeline, meeting all those silly people who died to keep you alive. And you know what I worked out? What you really need.
DOCTOR: For what?
MISSY: To know that you're just like me!
(The Tardis phone rings.)
MISSY: Oh, and now it begins. Doctor, I do believe you're on call. Miss Oswald expects. Who else but the girl who's got your number? Whoops!
DOCTOR: It was you!
(He remembers answering the phone in The Bells of St John.)
CLARA [memory]: Ah, hello.
DOCTOR 11 [memory]: Where did you get this number?
CLARA [memory]: The woman in the shop wrote it down. It's a helpline, isn't it?
MISSY: (Cockney) Computer helpline, love. That's the one. Best helpline in the universe.
DOCTOR: You put us together.
MISSY: I kept you together.
(Back to Deep Breath.)
CLARA [memory]: Who put that advert in the paper?
DOCTOR [memory]: Who gave you my number?
CLARA [memory]: The woman. The woman in the shop.
DOCTOR [memory]: Then there's a woman out there who's very keen that we stay together.
DOCTOR: Why?
MISSY: Cos she's perfect, innit? The control freak and the man who should never be controlled. You'd go to hell if she asked. And she would. The phone's ringing, Doctor. Can you hear that? Now that is the sound of your chain being yanked. Heel, Doctor! (as Clara) Help me, Doctor. Help me. Help me, Doctor.
(The Doctor answers the phone.)
DOCTOR: Clara?

[Graveyard]

CLARA: Doctor. With Danny.

[Cargo hold]

DOCTOR: Danny's dead, Clara.
CLARA [OC]: Not yet.

[Graveyard]

CLARA: Not quite. But he wants to be.
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara 
(Danny is crying nearby.)

[Cargo hold]

DOCTOR: Clara?

[Graveyard]

CLARA: He's a Cyberman.

[Cargo hold]

CLARA [OC]: Doctor, Danny's a Cyberman.

[Graveyard]

CLARA: And he's crying. Doctor, he feels it. He's crying.

[Main cabin]

(Kate grabs the phone as Cybermen hammer on the portholes.)
KATE: Message to Geneva. Tell them Boat One is going down. We don't anticipate survivors.
(One breaks through and grabs Ahmed around the neck. The decompression alarm sounds, then he is sucked outside.)

[Laboratory]

DOCTOR: Clara, don't do it. Just don't do it!

[Graveyard]

CLARA: It's in his chest. He says it's an inhibitor. It can delete emotion or something.

[Cargo hold]

DOCTOR: I know what it does. If you turn it on

[Graveyard]

DOCTOR [OC]: He'll become a Cyberman.
CLARA: He's already a Cyberman.

[Cargo hold]

DOCTOR: Not yet, he isn't.

[Graveyard]

CLARA: He's hurting because I hurt him and he wants it to stop.
DOCTOR [OC]: Stop the pain and he'll kill you!
CLARA: Look, are you going to help me, because I can't do this alone.

[Cargo hold]

DOCTOR: I'm not going to help you commit suicide.

[Graveyard]

CLARA: Look, the Tardis can home in on this call, right? Either you help me, or you leave me alone.

[Cargo hold]

DOCTOR: Clara? Clara, no  
(But she has thrown the phone away.)

[Graveyard]

(Clara is fiddling inside the chest disc in the gloom.)
CLARA: There's a lot of switches round the edge. I'm just going to try pressing them all.
CYBER-DANNY: Okay.
CLARA: I am so sorry.
CYBER-DANNY: Yeah.

[Cargo hold]

KATE: Doctor! The Cybermen are in. The plane's going down.
MISSY: Oh, great. It's the daughter one. Do you like her? I like her.
(Kate grabs onto a cargo strap as Missy makes the airplane veer sharply. The Doctor grabs another one. Then Missy opens the cargo hatch and Kate is sucked out, screaming.)
KATE: Aaaaaargh!
DOCTOR: Why did you do that? You didn't have to do that!
MISSY: Oh, don't be so selfish. I'm going to miss her, too. In fact, you know what? Just for that, I'm leaving. Boys, blow up this plane and, I don't know, Belgium, yeah? Kill some Belgians. Might as well. They're not even French. Byeeee!
(Missy teleports herself away. The Doctor is hanging on for dear life.)
DOCTOR: Aaah! Aaah!
(The airplane goes KaBOOM!)
DOCTOR: Argh! Argh!
(The Doctor freefalls.)

[Balcony]

(Missy and Seb watch him fall on a holo-screen.)
MISSY: Well, that's very boring. Oh, he's just going to squish. What kind of a way is that to die? That man has no finesse, none.
SEB: Well, it's quite dramatic.
MISSY: You're an AI interface. Kindly delete your opinions, thank you.
(The Doctor reaches into his inside coat pocket.)
SEB: W-w-what's he doing? Is he? Is he? Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no. N-now, that's
(The Doctor aims himself at something below. He breaks through the clouds and the city lights shine beneath him. And up comes the Tardis.)
SEB: Oh! Permission to squeeeee
(Missy deletes Seb. Permanently. The Doctor arrives at the Tardis, holding the key out in front of him. A few moments later the Tardis bounces up through the dark clouds, engines working.)

[Graveyard]

CLARA: Two more to go. Does it feel any different?
CYBER-DANNY: No.
(The Tardis materialises nearby.)
CLARA: Are you sure?
CYBER-DANNY: Yeah.
(The Tardis door opens and shuts.)
DOCTOR: Clara, don't!
(The other Cybermen are standing around, watching.)
CLARA: Help me.
DOCTOR: If you do what you're trying to do, if you succeed, he will snap you.
CLARA: No.
DOCTOR: Then he will step over your broken body and break another and another and another. He will never stop.
CYBER-DANNY: I will not harm her.
DOCTOR: P E. P E. P E.
CYBER-DANNY: Sir.
DOCTOR: I had a friend once. We ran together when I was little. And I thought we were the same. But when we grew up, we weren't. Now, she's trying to tear the world apart, and I can't run fast enough to hold it together. The difference is this.
(The Doctor puts his hand over Danny's chest disc.)
DOCTOR: Pain is a gift. Without the capacity for pain, we can't feel the hurt we inflict.
CYBER-DANNY: Are you telling me seriously, for real, that you can?
DOCTOR: Of course I can.
CYBER-DANNY: Then shame on you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, yes.
(The dark clouds rumble overhead.)
DOCTOR: Danny, Danny, I need you to tell me. What are the clouds going to do? What is the plan?
CYBER-DANNY: How would I know?
DOCTOR: You're part of a hive mind now. Presumably that's how you found Clara. Just look.
CYBER-DANNY: I can't see much.
DOCTOR: Look harder.
CYBER-DANNY: Clara, watch this. This is who the Doctor is. Watch the blood-soaked old general in action. I can't see properly, sir, because this needs activating. If you want to know what's coming, you have to switch it on. And didn't all of those beautiful speeches just disappear in the face of a tactical advantage? Sir.
DOCTOR: (sighs) I need to know. I need to know.
CYBER-DANNY: (sotto) Yes. (normal) Yes, you do.
CLARA: Give me the screwdriver.
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: Just do it, Doctor. Do as you are told.
(The Doctor meets Cyber-Danny's gaze then gives Clara the sonic screwdriver.)
CYBER-DANNY: Typical officer. Got to keep those hands clean.
(The Doctor walks away.)
CLARA: Just point and think, yeah?
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: Okay. I wasn't very good at it, but I did love you.
CYBER-DANNY: I love you too.
CLARA: I'm never going to say that again.
CYBER-DANNY: Me neither.
CLARA: Ready?
CYBER-DANNY: Yeah.
(Clara cries.)
CLARA: I feel like I'm killing you.
CYBER-DANNY: I'm already dead. You're here this time at least.
CLARA: Goodbye, Danny.
CYBER-DANNY: Goodbye, Clara.
(She activates the screwdriver. Danny's face goes blank and he straightens up. Clara turns off the screwdriver and goes to hug him.)
DOCTOR: Clara, no! Step away! He's activating! Clara, step away now! Don't. Danny. Danny, if you can hear me, if you're still there, what are the clouds going to do?
CYBER-DANNY: The rain will fall again. All humanity will die.
DOCTOR: And rise again as Cybermen.
CYBER-DANNY: Correct.
DOCTOR: How do we stop it?
CYBER-DANNY: We cannot be stopped.
(Missy beams herself in as Mary Poppins, floating gently to the ground under her umbrella.)
MISSY: Oh, that was brilliant! Oh, I love the telly here, but did you see that? Oh, Clara, you poor thing. You must feel like death. Let me pop away the pain.
(Missy starts to tap at her thingy. The Doctor grabs it and throws it away.)
DOCTOR: Don't you dare! Don't you think about it!
MISSY: Oh, sorry, hon, I'm just getting a bit carried away. It's your friends, they're so more-ish. Hmm?
(Clara picks up Missy's thingy and returns to Cyber-Danny's manly metal chest.)
MISSY: Oh, stop looking all cross-pants. I'm here to give you a gift. Could you at least try and be excited?
DOCTOR: What gift?
(Missy speaks into her bracelet.)
MISSY: Cyberdears!
(The Cybermen come to attention and play her game of Simon Says.)
MISSY: Look at Mummy! Raise your arms. Lower your arms. Raise your right. Lower your right. Turn on the spot. There are exits at the front and rear of the aircraft. Please follow the lights up the aisle. You see, Doctor? The power to slaughter whole worlds at a time, then make them do a safety briefing. Everyone who ever lived, man, woman and child, is now at my command. An indestructible army to rage across the universe. The more they kill, the more they recruit. Happy birthday. Oh! You didn't know, did you? It's lucky one of us remembers these things. Happy birthday (as Marilyn Monroe) Mister President.
(She puts her control bracelet on the Doctor's wrist then backs away and curtsys.)
CYBERMAN: Doctor.
(The Cybermen bow their heads to him.)
MISSY: Tiny bit pleased? Oh, go on, crack a smile. I want to see if your eyebrows drop off.
DOCTOR: All of this. All of it, just to give me an army?
MISSY: Well, I don't need one, do I? Armies are for people who think they're right. And nobody thinks they're righter than you. Give a good man firepower, and he'll never run out of people to kill.
DOCTOR: I don't want an army!
MISSY: Well, that's the trouble! Yes, you do! You've always wanted one! All those people suffering in the Dalek camps? Now you can save them. All those bad guys winning all the wars? Go and get the good guys back.
DOCTOR: Nobody can have that power.
MISSY: You will, because you don't have a choice. There's only way you can stop these clouds from opening up and killing all your little pets down here. Conquer the universe, Mister President. Show a bad girl how it's done.
(Missy drops a deep curtsy. The Doctor rips the bracelet off.)
DOCTOR: Why are you doing this?
MISSY: I need you to know we're not so different. I need my friend back. Every battle, every war, every invasion. From now on, you decide the outcome. What's the matter, Mister President? Don't you trust yourself?
DOCTOR [memory]: Tell me. Am I a good man?
DANNY [memory]: (saluting) Sir!
RUSTY [memory]: I see into your soul, Doctor. I see hatred.
DOCTOR [memory]: (to Robin Hood) I'm not a hero.
DALEK [memory]: You are a good Dalek.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you so much.
(He kisses Missy gently.)
DOCTOR: I really didn't know. I wasn't sure. You lose sight sometimes. Thank you! I am not a good man! I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am? I am an idiot, with a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through, helping out, learning. I don't need an army. I never have, because I've got them. Always them. Because love, it's not an emotion. Love is a promise.
(Cyber-Danny puts his arm around Clara.)
DOCTOR: And he will never hurt her. P E, catch!  
(The control bracelet lands in Cyber-Danny's hand.)
DOCTOR: You didn't notice, did you? While you were doing all your silly orders, while you where showing off, the one soldier not obeying.
MISSY: No, that's wrong. That's impossible.
CYBER-DANNY: The rain will not fall.
(He lets go of Clara and puts on the control bracelet as he walks towards Missy.)
MISSY: Oh? Why won't it?
CYBER-DANNY: The clouds will burn.
MISSY: And who'll burn them?
CYBER-DANNY: I will burn them.
MISSY: How?
CYBER-DANNY: I will burn.
MISSY: One burning Cyberman is hardly going to save the planet.
CYBER-DANNY: Correct.
(He speaks into the bracelet.)
CYBER-DANNY: Attention!
(The Cyber-Army spring to attention.)
CYBER-DANNY: This is not a good day. This is Earth's darkest hour. And look at you miserable lot. We are the Fallen. But today, we shall rise. The army of the dead will save the land of the living. This is not the order of a general, nor the whim of a lunatic.
MISSY: Excuse me?
CYBER-DANNY: This is a promise. The promise of a soldier! (to Clara) You will sleep safe tonight.
(Cyber-Danny ignites his rocket boots and rises from the ground. All the Cybermen do the same. They fly off into the clouds and explode, burning them away and letting the sunshine through. London, New York, the night sky at Sydney clears in a roll of flame.)
CLARA: Well. The clouds have all gone.
DOCTOR: Yes, burned up. Totally burnt. Burnt to nothing. Sorry.
MISSY: Ten zero eleven, zero zero by zero two
DOCTOR: What did you say??
MISSY: The current coordinates of Gallifrey. It's returned to it's original location. Didn't you ever think to look?
DOCTOR: You are lying!
MISSY: We can, we can go together, just you and me. Just like the old days.
DOCTOR: You'd be clapped in irons.
MISSY: If you like.
CLARA: Doctor, I'm assuming you'll remember those coordinates?
(Clara holds out Missy's thingy towards her.)
DOCTOR: No. No, don't you dare. I won't let you.
CLARA: Old friend, is she? If you have ever let this creature live, everything that happened today, is on you. All of it, on you. And you're not going to let her live again.
DOCTOR: Clara, all I'm doing is not letting you kill her. I never said I was letting her live.
CLARA: Really?
DOCTOR: If that's the only thing that will stop you, yes.
(Clara hands over the thingy.)
MISSY: Seriously. Oh, Doctor. To save her soul? But who, my dear, will save yours? Say something nice. Please?
DOCTOR: You win.
MISSY: I know.
(The Doctor prepares to vaporise Missy, but another energy bolt gets there first. It was a Cyberman with a dark chest disc. It points to something lying amongst the gravestones.)
CLARA: Doctor!
(They run to where Kate is lying on the ground.)
DOCTOR: Kate. She's breathing! She's alive! She can't be here.
CLARA: She is.
DOCTOR: She fell out of a plane. The Cyberman must have caught her.
CLARA: Doctor, she's talking about her dad.
DOCTOR: Of course. The Earth's darkest hour and mine. Where else would you be?
(The Doctor salutes the spirit of Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart. It acknowledges with a bow of its head then blasts off into the wide blue yonder.)
DOCTOR: (sotto) Thank you.

[Clara's flat]

(Two weeks later. Clara is asleep when she hears a distant voice.)
DANNY [OC]: Clara. Clara.
CLARA: Danny? Danny? Is that you?
(She goes to the front door, where a soft white light is glowing.)
CLARA: Please say it's you.
DANNY [OC]: Clara.
CLARA: The Doctor told me about the bracelet, how it can let Missy travel from one world to the other.
DANNY [OC]: This place is dying now.
CLARA: Yes, but the bracelet can bring you home.
DANNY [OC]: There's only enough power for one trip.
CLARA: Then come on. Hurry up!
DANNY [OC]: Just one trip. One trip, one person.
(A figure starts to come through the light.)
CLARA: Danny!
(It is the boy in the football shirt, the one Danny killed all those years ago.)
DANNY [OC]: You need to find his parents. He died a long time ago.
(The boy takes a deep breath.)
DANNY [OC]: I'm sorry, Clara. (crying) I truly am. I had, I had promises to keep.
(The bracelet falls from the boy's wrist and the energy fizzles out. The white light fades away.)

[Café]

(Clara is waiting at a table when the door opens. The Doctor sits down opposite her.)
DOCTOR: Hey.
CLARA: Hey.
DOCTOR: I got your message.
CLARA: Two weeks late.
DOCTOR: Not bad.
CLARA: Improving.
DOCTOR: I see you've got news for me.
CLARA: News?
(She is wearing the now defunct bracelet.)
DOCTOR: He figured it out then? P E figured out there was a way home.
CLARA: Yeah. Yeah, he did.
DOCTOR: Oh, good old P E. He'll make a maths teacher yet.
CLARA: Listen, Doctor. There's, there's something that I have to tell you and, er, it's not good news so just, just listen, okay?
DOCTOR: I know.
CLARA: Sorry?
DOCTOR: I know exactly what you've got to tell me.
CLARA: You do?
DOCTOR: You and Danny are together now. That's great. That's how it should be. But the old man and the blue box, that's never going to fit in. So no more flying around. No more lying.
CLARA: Okay, no, that's not exactly
DOCTOR: It's fine.
CLARA: No, it's not fine. It, it really isn't fine.
DOCTOR: I've found Gallifrey.
CLARA: Wow! Oh, my God,
(The Doctor sets the Tardis in flight to 10-0-11-00:02.)
DOCTOR: I entered the coordinates, just like she said. And I found Gallifrey. For once, she wasn't lying.
(The Doctor opens the Tardis door and looks out into the blackness of space. He shuts it again and walks back to the console, then hits it hard, repeatedly, making sparks fly.)
CLARA: So, what are you going to do now?
DOCTOR: Go home.
CLARA: Okay.
DOCTOR: Gallifrey can be a good place. I can help make it that.
CLARA: What, you?
DOCTOR: Shut up!
CLARA: You won't just steal a Tardis and run away?
DOCTOR: No, not this time. Never again.
(Clara looks at the Tardis through the window.)
CLARA: Never again.
DOCTOR: It's a long commute, so, you know, I thought, with you and Danny
CLARA: Yeah. Me and Danny. Me and Danny, we are going to be fine. Don't you worry. You go home. Go home. Go be a king or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I might do that.
CLARA: Or queen, you know. Whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah, queen, that would be good too.
CLARA: Yeah. (big sigh) Tell you what, seeing as it's goodbye, shall we break a habit?
DOCTOR: What? What habit?
CLARA: Hug.
DOCTOR: Why not. Within reason.
(He stands up.)
DOCTOR: Come on, you're on the clock.
CLARA: Fair enough.
(So she stands and puts her arms around his neck, and he slowly puts his arms around her.)
CLARA: Why don't you like hugging, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Never trust a hug. It's just a way to hide your face.
CLARA: Yeah.

[Outside the Tardis]

CLARA: Doctor? Travelling with you made me feel really special. Thank you for that. Thank you for making me feel special.
DOCTOR: Thank you for exactly the same.
(He goes into the Tardis. It dematerialises without anyone paying any attention, and without kicking up any dust like it used to in the old days. Clara walks away. We roll the final credits but then get interrupted at the end of the cast list.)

[Tardis]

(Knocking on the door.)
MAN [OC]: Coo-ee! Hello? Doctor? You know it can't end like that. Hmm? We need to get this sorted and quickly. She's not all right, you know. And neither are you. I'm coming in.
(The door opens to let in a flurry of snowflakes.)
MAN [OC]: Ah, there you are. I knew I'd get round to you eventually. Now, stop gawping, and tell me.
(We see that the speaker is a chunky silver bearded man in red fur trimmed cap and suit, with a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles half way down his nose.)
SANTA: What do you want for Christmas?


[Clara's bedroom]
(It is the day before Christmas in Clara's new home, with staircase and front door. All the decorations are up and that very rare meteorological event for London - snow in December - can be seen through the windows. A crash and a sudden heavy fall of snow past the bedroom window wakes Clara.)
SANTA [OC]: Argh! (Bells jingle) Moron! Numbskull! Elf!
IAN [OC]: That's racist!
SANTA [OC]: Of course it's not racist, you are an elf.
(Clara gets out of bed, puts on a dressing gown and opens the door onto the flat roof between three sides of the roof, and which has a skylight in the middle. She has the only entrance to it from her attic bedroom. There are wrapped presents and small orange fruit scattered all around. Three figures are looking at a sleigh standing on its end against the -) 

[Clara's roof]

SANTA: Chimneys?
IAN: I'm sorry!
SANTA: I'm just checking that you can see these massive chimneys.
IAN: I, er, they, they're hard to miss.
SANTA: Well, as you've clearly demonstrated, Ian.
WOLF: Donner! Donner and Blitzen. Come on down. Down here, boys.
(There are three members of species Rangifer tarandus flying around, bells jingling on their harness, and one has a glowing red nose. This is, of course, impossible.)
WOLF: Good boys, good boys. Good boy. Rudolph?
SANTA: Just, just clear all the tangerines up. Pick 'em up. All of them, Ian.
IAN: You know no one really likes the tangerines, don't you?
(We now see that this is Dan Starkey out from under the Strax makeup.)
SANTA: How dare you! That's my signature gift. That and the walnut.
WOLF: Down here, boys, come on. Come. Rudolph?
(Wolf the elf kindly has his name embroidered on the back of his jacket. Ian looks up from gathering tangerines.)
IAN: Er, sir? We've been seen.
SANTA: Hello.
CLARA: Hello.
WOLF: Hello, ha ha!
IAN: Hello, human.
WOLF: You can't call her human.
IAN: It's not racist. They don't mind.
SANTA: Hush up, both of you. Oh, sorry about this, girl. We are just three passing, perfectly ordinary roof people, doing some emergency roof things. Carry on. Merry Christmas. If, if it is Christmas, I mean. Heh, heh. I don't much care for things like that, myself. Pfft. I mean, Christmas. (laughs)
CLARA: Are you Santa Claus?
SANTA: Me? No. Oh, no. It's ridiculous. Heh, heh. No, no, no.
(But then Clara sees the reindeer fly past behind him.)
WOLF: Rudolph! Rudolph! Down here now!
SANTA: All right, fine, yes. Yes, it's me. Ha! Guilty. How did you recognise me?
WOLF: You know how you grew that beard as a bit of a disguise? People have picked up on it.
CLARA: Okay. No. Hang on. Stop. Shut up. What? Seriously, you, you're Father Christmas. You're real.
SANTA: Of course I'm real.
WOLF: How could he not be real?
SANTA: Huh? How do you think those presents got under the tree every year? By magic?
CLARA: Well, I thought it was my mum and
IAN + WOLF: Mum and Dad?
SANTA: Ho, ho!
IAN: Well, of course it was.
WOLF: I mean, it makes perfect sense.
IAN: Yeah, your mum and dad, one day a year, for no particular reason, just out of the blue, suddenly decide to give you a great, big pile of presents.
(So no one there knows about the tradition of gift giving on Dec 25th, and that Santa Claus is really Sinterklass which is Dutch for Saint Nicholas who had a reputation for secret gift giving, and whose day is 7th Dec. Tut. What is modern education coming to?)
WOLF: No, no, no. Because they love you so much. It's a lovely story, dear.
IAN: Yeah, but it's time to start living in the real world, yeah?
(Santa has got his notebook out.)
SANTA: Okay. Right. Clara Oswald. Mostly favours travel books, science kits, strict ban on hair products. Marginal for the naughty list, '93. Tut, tut, tut. Believer until the age of nine. Why did you stop?
CLARA: Because you're a fairy tale. I grew out of fairy tales.
SANTA: (sighs) Did you, Clara? Did you really?
(The Tardis materialises next to Clara's roof door.)
DOCTOR: Clara, I want you to step inside the Tardis. I don't want you to talk, I want you to do as I ask. Please.
IAN: That was good, with the box.
WOLF: Hmph. Not often we get upstaged on a rooftop. Hmm.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm really here. I'm back. Now get inside the Tardis.
(Clara obeys silently and shuts the door.)
DOCTOR: I know what this is. I know what's happening, and I know what's at stake.
SANTA: I don't think you do, Doctor. But I promise, before this Christmas Day is done, you will be glad of my help.
DOCTOR: Happy Easter.
(He goes into the Tardis.)
WOLF: Ooh, brutal!
IAN: Cool exit line, though.
SANTA: Be sure to save some room for a tangerine, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Nobody likes the tangerines.

[Tardis]

CLARA: I'm really back here. This is, this is real, yeah?
(The Doctor starts setting coordinates.)
CLARA: Doctor? Talk to me. I never thought I was going to see you again. What is going on out there? What's happening?
(The time rotor starts spinning overhead.)
CLARA: Oh, that noise. Never knew how much I loved it.
DOCTOR: There's something you have to ask yourself, and it's important. Your life may depend on it. Everybody's life. Do you really believe in Santa Claus?
CLARA: Do you know what? Yeah. Right now, here, I think I do.

[Corridor]

(On a massive icesheet, with green aurora borealis shimmering on the horizon, is a cluster of huts and vehicles with caterpillar tracks, and a satellite dish. Inside, a young woman is wearing a headset with a mini-cam and looking very nervous. A woman speaks to her through her earpiece.)
ASHLEY [OC]: You are now twenty feet from the infirmary. In a moment, as soon as you're ready

[Control room]

(They have her on a monitor, and are recording the feed. The place is full of screens and illuminated keyboards, also dangling light bulbs and some easy chairs.)
ASHLEY: We'll disable the security protocols.
(An older Scots woman speaks.)
BELLOWS: Your neural link is good and holding. We stand ready to abort and extract at the first sign of an anomaly.
(The man in charge - Michael Troughton, son of the second Doctor, Patrick, speaks.)
ALBERT: We're going to be with you

[Corridor]

ALBERT [OC]: Every step of the way, Shona.
ASHLEY [OC]: We're all depending on you

[Control room]

ASHLEY: And we know you won't let us down. Shona, I'm opening the door.
(Auto door lock system 036-8514//412 DR07 PURGE.)

[Corridor]

SHONA: I need the toilet!

[Control room]

BELLOWS: No, you don't. We're monitoring your bodily functions.
SHONA [OC]: And how are you monitoring that? Cos that's rude!

[Corridor]

SHONA: That is perverted.

[Control room]

ALBERT: Do you remember my briefing, Shona?

[Corridor]

SHONA: Yeah. Well, no. I remember some of it.

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Some of it?
BELLOWS: How much?

[Corridor]

SHONA: Till he put his hand on my knee.

[Control room]

SHONA [OC]: And then I was just grossing.
ALBERT: It was intended as a comfort.
BELLOWS: For whom?
SHONA [OC]: All I could see was his nose, with all the little hairs coming out of it.

[Corridor]

SHONA: Have you seen those? It's like he's got insects trapped up there, all trying to escape with their wee, wiggly legs.

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Okay. Let's just go through this again.

[Corridor]

ASHLEY [OC]: There are four sleepers inside the infirmary. You're fine, so long as they don't wake up.
BELLOWS [OC]: She's in range.

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Shona, I'm unsealing the infirmary.

[Corridor]

ASHLEY [OC]: From now on, everything you think and feel, everything you see, will be available to them.

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Most of it's fine, like traffic noise when you're sleeping, so long as you don't think about them.

[Corridor]

ASHLEY [OC]: So long as you don't look at them. So don't think about them

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Don't look at them.

[Infirmary]

(Beep and the doors slide open. There are figures on the beds covered in sheets.)
SHONA: I thought there was going to be music.
BELLOWS [OC]: We've got your playlist

[Control room]

BELLOWS: Ready to go.
ASHLEY: Focus on the words of the song, try to remember what comes next.

[Infirmary]

ASHLEY [OC]: That will work like interference.
BELLOWS [OC]: Here comes your earworm.
(That perennial favourite earworm, Merry Christmas Everybody by Slade, starts playing.)

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Keep your eyes on the floor.

[Infirmary]

ASHLEY [OC]: Shut them, where possible.
SLADE: Are you hanging up your stockings on the wall?

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Focus on the music and move forward through the infirmary.
(Shona closes her eyes and moves to the beat.)
SLADE: It's the time that every Santa has a ball. Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
(Shona hums and goes into a dance.)
SLADE: Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
SLADE + SHONA: Do the fairies keep him sober for the day?
BELLOWS: Oh, dear Lord, she's not actually
ASHLEY: If dancing works, it works.
ALBERT: This is insane.

[Infirmary]

SLADE + SHONA: So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.

[Control room]

ASHLEY: This is working.

[Infirmary]

SLADE + SHONA: Look to the future now, It's only just begun. Are you waiting for the family to arrive? Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
(Warning Exterior door. Low temperature past this point. 01-180-2. The locking wheel starts to turn, then it opens. Shona, who is on her knees playing air guitar, screams.)

[Control room]

ASHLEY: Shona? Shona, what's wrong?

[Infirmary]

SHONA: We've, we've got ghosts!
ASHLEY [OC]: Ghosts?
SHONA: Yeah, yeah. It's a skeleton man and a girl in a nightie.
(The Doctor and Clara enter. Clara has sensibly gained a parka and sheepskin booties. The door closes behind them.)

[Control room]

(They look at the figures on the beds.)
CLARA [on monitor]: Doctor?
SHONA [on monitor]: No, no, no, you're making me think about them.

[Infirmary]

SHONA: Don't make me think about them!
CLARA: What are they?
(The figures start to sit up slowly.)
SHONA: Look. Just don't ask, yeah? And don't look. Don't make me think about them.
(The sheets fall from their faces to reveal blank slimy carapaces. The Doctor scans them with his screwdriver as they get out of bed.)
DOCTOR: Deaf. Blind. How can they see us? How do they even know that we're here?
SHONA: They can only see you, yeah, if you see them. So just, so just don't look, don't even think about them.
DOCTOR: Oh, telepathic. They can home in on their own image in someone else's brain. Third-party perception. Mind piracy. We're being hacked.
CLARA: What does that even mean?
(The Sleepers are all standing.)
DOCTOR: The visual input from your optic nerve is being streamed to their brains. Stop broadcasting. Close your eyes.
(Clara obeys. The images of the alien heads stretch and morph.)
CLARA: They're still coming, aren't they?
DOCTOR: It's because you're still thinking about them. So long as you retain them as an active memory, they can still home in. Think about something else.
CLARA: How?
SHONA: (sings) So here it is, Merry Christmas
CLARA: Why is she singing?
SHONA: Everybody's having fun
DOCTOR: (sotto) She's running interference. She's trying to distract herself. Three hundred and four minus seventeen.
CLARA: Sorry, what?
DOCTOR: Plus twenty. Just do it!
CLARA: Five hundred and seven.
(Ooo, 200 out! Should started with 504, then.)
(A crack like a mucus filled maw open in the carapaces.)
DOCTOR: Minus fourteen, times four.
CLARA: One thousand nine hundred and seventy two.
DOCTOR: Stop being so good at arithmetic.
CLARA: I can't help it!
DOCTOR: Danny Pink! What is Danny Pink up to right now? He's probably flirting with your neighbour or texting women of low moral character.
(After seeing Danny in her mind, Clara opens her eyes and slaps the Doctor's face, hard. The Sleepers, who are now very close to them, close their maws.)
CLARA: (sotto) Don't you dare. Don't you dare say that.
DOCTOR: I was only
CLARA: Danny Pink is dead.
(The Sleepers growl.)
DOCTOR: No, he's not.
CLARA: He's dead.
(The infirmary door opens and the rest of the crew run in with very, very big guns.)
ASHLEY: Go, run, now, now, now!
(The Doctor turns to grab Shona.)
DOCTOR: Come on, quick, quick, quick, come on!
(Something like a glutenous spider drops down on a thread of mucus from the ceiling.)
ALBERT: Here they come!
(Then lots of them.)
DOCTOR: No!
(One heads squarely for the Doctor's face. Cut to exterior, and a big explosion which destroys the exterior door. A tangerine rolls in from the snow, followed by a troop of varicoloured slinkies and toy robots. Rudolph rears up, with Santa on his back, viewed through the hole where the exterior door used to be. Santa dismounts.)
SANTA: Whoa, whoa! Ah! Good boy.
(He walks into the infirmary, followed by Ian with a balloon toy, and Wolf with an air gun.)
SANTA: Well, now. What seems to be the problem? This is the North Pole. We don't want any trouble here.
(Rudolph bellows.)
SANTA: Hey, Rudolph.
(Santa uses his car key fob to 'lock' Rudolph. Beep!)
SANTA: Easy, son. Oi! Sleepy heads! It's Christmas Eve, early to bed.
(Santa claps his hands and the Sleepers return to their beds.)
ASHLEY: Who the hell are you?
DOCTOR: Oh, take a guess. Go on, push the boat out. Tooth Fairy, maybe? Easter Bunny?
IAN: Shut your mouth, wise guy, or you get yours.
WOLF: It's a balloon animal.
IAN: That's a toy gun.
WOLF: Yeah, well, at least it's unsuitable for children under four. Parts small enough to swallow, so watch out.
(Santa sighs.)
SHONA: Now, this is ridiculous. Am I, am I dreaming?
DOCTOR: Oh, very good.
ASHLEY: I need to know exactly who you are, and what's happening here.
(Santa gently points her gun away from his midriff.)
SANTA: Hello, Ashley. Lead scientist on a polar expedition. Oh, that microscope really paid off, didn't it? Now, your mum and dad wanted me to get you a toy one, but sometimes, I take a chance.
ASHLEY: Who are you? Why are you dressed like that?
SANTA: Why do you think?
SHONA: Come on, this is mental. This is totally not happening.
SANTA: I got three words, Shona. Don't make me use 'em.
SHONA: What three words?
SANTA: My. Little. Pony.
SHONA: Shut up, you.
SANTA: Yeah? I've got lots more, babe.
SHONA: I will mark you, Santa.
(Shona makes claws of her hands.)
CLARA: Okay, Doctor, are you going to explain? What is going on?
SANTA: It's an invasion, Miss Oswald.
CLARA: An invasion of, of what, elves?
WOLF: Whoa! That is racist.
IAN: Elfist!
WOLF: Yeah. Which is a bit hypocritical, from someone of your height.
(Wolf is ever so slightly taller than Clara. Santa fetches a large transparent specimen container 16367//KB from his saddlebags.)
SANTA: Huh? You seen them before, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I've heard of them.
SANTA: The Kantrofarri.
DOCTOR: Colloquially known as the Dream Crabs.
SANTA: Yeah. Depending on how many of those are already on Earth, the human race may well have seen its last day. So, are we going to stand about arguing about whether I'm real or not, or are we going to get busy saving Christmas?
IAN: Oh, ho, ho! Santa goes badass!
WOLF: He's giving me the feels.
SANTA: Shut up. That's a, that's a verbal warning. Please, stop it.

[Laboratory]

CLARA: Is it dead?
(The Doctor and Ashley are looking at the Dream Crab in the container.)
DOCTOR: I don't know. Possibly.
ASHLEY: I'm assuming extra-terrestrial.
DOCTOR: Oh, definitely.
ASHLEY: Then how can you have heard of these things?
DOCTOR: Guess.
ASHLEY: Because you're extra-terrestrial, too.
DOCTOR: Do you believe that?

[Control room]

(Shona is interviewing the three newcomers in an alcove. Santa has got a mug of drink. Ian is flicking through his smart phone.)
SHONA: If you are Santa
SANTA: Mmm hmm.
SHONA: What are you doing here?
SANTA: It's the North Pole. And I own it.
IAN: He means the actual pole.
WOLF: It goes right through the middle of the workshop.
IAN: I've got a selfie with it.
WOLF: Show her. Look at Ian.
(Ian holds out the phone with the photo on it.)
SHONA: The North Pole isn't an actual pole.
IAN: Course it is. Look.
SHONA: If it was an actual pole, it would not be stripy.
WOLF: It's got to be stripy.
IAN: Otherwise, you couldn't see it moving round.
WOLF: Mmm. It's actually basic physics.

[Laboratory]

ASHLEY: Why's it called a Dream Crab, for a start?
DOCTOR: Theorise.
ASHLEY: Because it generates a telepathic field.
DOCTOR: And?
ASHLEY: Alters perception.
DOCTOR: Meaning?
ASHLEY: I seem to be doing all the work here.
CLARA: Meaning we can't trust anything that we see or hear.
DOCTOR: Go to the window.
ASHLEY: Why?
DOCTOR: Because it gets worse.
(Ashley looks out at an incongruous blue Police [public call] Box.)
ASHLEY: What is that?
DOCTOR: That's how Clara and I got here.
ASHLEY: In a box?
DOCTOR: Technically, in a telephone kiosk.
ASHLEY: (laughs) How?
DOCTOR: Because it's a spaceship in disguise. You know what the big problem is in telling fantasy and reality apart?
ASHLEY: What?
DOCTOR: They're both ridiculous. 

[Control room]

SHONA: It's Christmas Eve!
SANTA: Yeah. You don't have to tell me that.
SHONA: Yeah, well, then why aren't you out delivering presents?
SANTA: Technically, I am.
SHONA: Well, you're not. You're stood right there.
SANTA: Oh, Shona, grow up, love.
IAN: Yeah, do the math, baby.
(Shona takes notes.)
SANTA: There's not just one Santa delivery team. How could there be? There are five hundred and twenty six million four hundred and three thousand and twelve children all expecting presents before tomorrow morning. So, hmm, that's twenty two million children per hour. It's impossible! Obviously, I've got a second sledge.

[Laboratory]

CLARA: So we don't know what is real and what isn't?
DOCTOR: Exactly.
CLARA: Are we in danger?
DOCTOR: Oh, we are well way past danger, Clara. If I'm right, and I usually am, we're dying.
ASHLEY: Then how do we stay alive?
DOCTOR: I like you. Straight to the point. I want you to show me how you first encountered those creatures, and what happened to those people in the infirmary. I notice you all wear mini-cams, so I assume that there is footage.
ASHLEY: Is it possible I'm about to work with someone who might be a dream?
DOCTOR: If it helps, so am I.
ASHLEY: We have footage on the drives. I'll see what I can pull up.
DOCTOR: Ashley, what's this polar base for? Why are you all here?
ASHLEY: It's a long story.
(Ashley leaves.)
CLARA: What you said about Danny. Unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I know. I had to flood your mind with random emotion.
CLARA: Random?
DOCTOR: You never told me he was dead. You said he made it back.
CLARA: Well, I lied. I lied, so you'd go home to Gallifrey instead of fussing about me.
DOCTOR: I never found Gallifrey. I lied, so you'd stay with Danny.
CLARA: So we're dying, then?
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: Why?
DOCTOR: Oh, complicated.
CLARA: How long do we have?
DOCTOR: No idea.
CLARA: Just. Doctor, give me something to do.
DOCTOR: Trust nothing. Accept nothing you see. Whatever happens, interrogate everything.
CLARA: In case it's a lie.
DOCTOR: In case it's a lie.

[Control room]

SHONA: Reindeer can't fly. They just can't.
SANTA: No. No, they can't. It's a scientific impossibility. That is why I feed mine magic carrots.
DOCTOR: You all right?
SHONA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to talk sense into er, Beardy-Weirdy.
DOCTOR: You don't seem much like a scientist.
SHONA: That's a bit rude, coming from a magician.
DOCTOR: Why are you out here? What brought you to the North Pole?
SHONA: Long story, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You missed the killer question.
SHONA: Sorry, what?
DOCTOR: Beardy-Weirdy.
SANTA: Yeah?
DOCTOR: How do you get all the presents in the sleigh?
SANTA: It's bigger on the inside.
WOLF: Ooh!
ASHLEY: Doctor?
(Professor Albert is gnawing on a turkey drumstick.)
ALBERT: Sorry. Starving.
DOCTOR: What am I looking at?
(The monitor says Headcam: Carter.)
BELLOWS: Footage from a week ago. A side expedition from our main mission.
DOCTOR: What is your main mission?
BELLOWS: Long story. Ice cave directly beneath this base. Now, look at what we found.
(A cluster of Dream crabs hanging amongst icicles.)
BELLOWS: Dormant at first.
DOCTOR: Until you looked at them too long. Till you thought about them.
BELLOWS: Exactly.
DOCTOR: Sleeping. Probably been down there for centuries.
(Anyone else thinking The Thing meets Alien?)
CLARA: And it wakes up when you think about it?
(The Dream Crab twitches in its container.)
DOCTOR: They can detect their own mental picture in any nearby mind.
ASHLEY: That's Bellows' theory.
BELLOWS: It's like it responds to the presence of any data concerning itself.
DOCTOR: Oh. That was always the legend. You think about a Dream Crab, a Dream Crab is coming for you.
(The Dream Crab twitches the container off the table, and it breaks.)
ALBERT: This is where it gets really nasty.
CLARA: Only now?
(A Dream Crab descends onto the headcam and it goes into static.)
DOCTOR: Okay, then what?
(Bellows switches the image to the infirmary, with them putting the Sleepers into bed. Albert's drumstick is a never-ending feast.)
ALBERT: They're a bit like Facehuggers, aren't they?
DOCTOR: Face huggers?
ALBERT: You know, Alien. The horror movie, Alien.
DOCTOR: There's a horror movie called Alien? That's really offensive. No wonder everyone keeps invading you.
BELLOWS: First, they just slept. Couple of days, just lying there.
DOCTOR: And then they became aggressive.
ASHLEY: If we got close enough, yeah.
DOCTOR: It would take the Dream Crab a little while to take control. Depends how much of the host brain was
ASHLEY: Was what?
DOCTOR: Digested.
ASHLEY: Are they still alive under those things?
DOCTOR: Depends what you call alive.
ASHLEY: Are they suffering?
DOCTOR: No. No, no. no, no, no. The Dream Crab induces a dream state. Keeps you happy and relaxed, in a perfectly realised dream world, as you dissolve. Merciful, I suppose.
ALBERT: Compared to what?
DOCTOR: Compared to that turkey leg you keep eating. Could you rewind for me? I'd like to see them dormant again. Clara, could you fetch me the dead one?
CLARA: Maybe I could fetch you a cup of tea while I'm at it.
DOCTOR: Ooh. Yes, and a punch in the face, too.
CLARA: My very next suggestion.
DOCTOR: Fair enough.

[Laboratory]

(Clara steps on shards of broken glass. She sees that the table is empty.)
CLARA: Doctor?
(She sees part of the broken container on the floor and goes underneath the table to look at it closely. The Dream Crab descends from the ceiling. Clara gasps.)

[Control room]

ASHLEY: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: We're thinking about it. Clara!

[Laboratory]

CLARA: One hundred minus forty two is three hundred and fifty eight times three is one thousand seven hundred and seventy four minus thirty two is one hundred and forty two divided by seven is twenty and, and, and a bit. Think about something else. Think about something else. Danny Pink, Danny, Danny. Danny Pink, I love you.
(The Crab is visible through the slats of the table.)
CLARA: And I'll never see you again, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied. I am sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
(Mucus falls in a long stream in front of her face, and she screams, then stupidly turns around to look upwards. The Dream Crab breaks the slats apart and drops.)

[Clara's bedroom]

(Clara wakes up in bed. It is full daylight. The door opens and a man in a red nylon fake fur-trimmed suit and false beard enters.)
DANNY: Ho, ho, ho.
CLARA: Who are you?
DANNY: What do you mean, who am I? Who do you think I am?
(He pulls down the long white beard to reveal his short dark one.)
CLARA: Danny?
DANNY: Merry Christmas. Come on!
CLARA: Come on where?
DANNY: Downstairs.
CLARA: Why?
DANNY: Well, you know what day it is.
CLARA: What day is it?
DANNY: Easter. It's Easter Day. That's why I'm dressed like this, I'm Father Easter.
CLARA: Is that a thing?
DANNY: No. Because it's Christmas!
CLARA: Oh. Well, you've made me want chocolate now.
DANNY: Good. Come on. You, out of bed. Downstairs. I have surprises.
CLARA: Tickets for the Indian Orient Express. That painting we saw in Paris, and permission to own a cat.
DANNY: How did you know?
CLARA: Because those are exactly the things I want, and you are too clever ever to be wrong.
DANNY: How do you make you clever into me being clever?
CLARA: I always protect your ego from the truth.
DANNY: Oh, er, thank you for that.
CLARA: It's Christmas.
DANNY: Hurry up, then! 

[Top landing]

(She goes out onto the spacious top landing, turns and sees a blackboard with CLARA!! written on it. Danny is halfway down the stairs already.)
CLARA: Danny? Whose blackboard is that?
DANNY: What blackboard? Are you coming?
CLARA: Yeah, just a moment!
(She turns away for an instant and when she turns back the word has changed to DREAMING!!)
DANNY: Clara.
CLARA: Coming!
(She picks up the blackboard eraser and wipes over the word, turning it to DYING!!)
DANNY: Clara!
CLARA: Yeah. Just a minute.
(She tries rubbing it out again. The word transforms to YOU then ARE then DYING! )
DOCTOR [OC]: You are dying.
(Now the whole landing is lined with blackboards with the word DYING! written on them. The Doctor's voice echoes from a distance.)
DOCTOR [OC]: Dying! Dying! Clara! Clara! Clara!
(She closes her eyes and the scene returns to bright and pleasant.)
DANNY: Well, come on then. You don't know what I'm wearing underneath this Santa outfit.
CLARA: Your pyjamas. You're too shy to wear less than two layers.
DANNY: You could have used your imagination.
CLARA: Yeah, I don't really have to.
(There is now a blackboard at the top of the stairs behind her, saying CLARA!!)
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara!

[Laboratory]

(The Doctor is holding Clara's hand. She is lying on the floor with a Crab over her face.)
DOCTOR: Clara, you're dreaming. You're dying. Can you hear me? Clara?
ASHLEY: We did try to waken the others. No stimulus worked.
DOCTOR: Okay, we kill it. We find a way to kill it and we get it off of her. How do we kill it?
ASHLEY: There's no way to kill it without killing your friend, too. And as a scientist, may I just say, I don't like the way you're talking.
DOCTOR: Santa. In the infirmary, you told the Sleepers to go to bed, and they obeyed you.
SANTA: Sorry, doesn't mean I can get that creature off her.
DOCTOR: No, but you can get back in there unharmed.
SHONA: What? You're asking Santa for help? He doesn't exist.
DOCTOR: And how would you know that? How did you become an expert on what does and doesn't exist?
SANTA: I can commit several million housebreaks in one night dressed in a red suit with jingle bells, so of course I can get back into the infirmary.
DOCTOR: Good. Because there is only one way that I can communicate with Clara.

[Clara's living room]

(Fairy lights are trailed all over the place, and the happy couple are curled up on the corner sofa by firelight. There is a knock on the front door which interrupts a kiss.)
DANNY: Your dad?
CLARA: Going by the timing, I'd say so.
DANNY: Mmm.
CLARA: If you let him anywhere near the subject of golf, I will do a thing, and it will not be a good thing.
DANNY: Um, aren't we giving him golf clubs?
CLARA: And I'm prepared to use them.
(They both chuckle as she gets up and goes to the door.)
DOCTOR: Hi.
CLARA: Hi. Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not real, Clara. You know it's not real. It's a dream, and it's killing you.
CLARA: Merry Christmas.
(The Doctor closes the door behind him and follows Clara into the living room.)
CLARA: You remember Danny, of course.
DOCTOR: Not as well as you, clearly. You've made him a fraction taller. Merry Christmas, PE.
DANNY: Compliments of the season, sir.
DOCTOR: Dialogue's pretty good, too. Nice work. It's all in the detail.
CLARA: Just stop it.
DOCTOR: He's not real, Clara. None of this is real. What's real is there is an alien organism wrapped around your face, keeping you warm and happy while it eats you.
DANNY: Mince pie, anyone?
DOCTOR: You're dying.
CLARA: If this is a dream, how can you be here? How can we both be having the same dream?
DOCTOR: There was only one way to get to you.
CLARA: And what was that?
DOCTOR: I'm dying, too.

[Laboratory]

(The Doctor is lying next to Clara with a Dream Crab on his face.)
ASHLEY: Have we just killed him? Have we just made it worse?
SANTA: He thinks he can join the dream, and get her out. Have a little faith.

[Clara's living room]

CLARA: You just wake up. Just leave me here, please.
(The Doctor touches her right temple.)
DOCTOR: You have a pain right here. It's like an ice cream pain, but gentle. Do you know what that is? The skin and bone have been parted, probably half an inch, and something has pushed right into the soft tissue of your brain and is very slowly dissolving it. I want you to picture it this way. Somebody has put a straw right through your skull and is drinking you. You should be screaming with agony, but there's anaesthetic. Everything around you right now, even Danny, especially Danny, that's the anaesthetic.
(I now have the picture from Phantasms stuck in my head of Doctor Crusher with a straw stuck into Will Riker's skull. Lovely. Goes really well with the Slade earworm.)
DANNY: Why are you doing this? Why are you saying all of that?
DOCTOR: Because it's true. How long do you think you've been here?
CLARA: All day.
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. Barely five minutes. Because dream time goes faster. Because this isn't real. Danny isn't real. Danny Pink died saving the world.
DANNY: I really didn't.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I thought there was a way back for him, but I was wrong. I can't change that. He's dead.
DANNY: I didn't die saving the world, Doctor, I died saving Clara. The rest of you just got lucky. How long has she got?
DOCTOR: Minutes, till it's irreversible.
DANNY: Well then, get out the way.
(The Doctor moves aside and Danny walks up to Clara.)
DANNY: I'm a dream and you know I am, right? (Clara nods.) Right, one thing. But it's important. It's a very important thing. That is totally how you guessed all of my presents.
CLARA: I miss you.
DANNY: Five minutes.
CLARA: What?
DANNY: You can miss me for five minutes a day. And you'd better do it properly. You'd better be sad. I expect my five. But all the rest of the time, Clara, all the rest of the time, every single second, you just get the hell on with it. Clear?
CLARA: Don't you soldier me.
DANNY: Do as you're told.
DOCTOR: Brave.
DANNY: Dead already. How does she wake up?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Just try. Accept this isn't real, and try.
DANNY: Do it. For me.
CLARA: (crying) When I wake up, you won't be there.
DANNY: Do you know why people get together at Christmas? Because every time they do, it might be the last time. Every Christmas is last Christmas, and this is ours. This was a bonus. This is extra. But now it's time to wake up.
(Danny and Clara kiss.)

[Laboratory]

(The Doctor wakes with a cry and the Dream Crab falls off him. Clara's Dream Crab leaves her face and she coughs.)
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara, look at me, Clara! Clara! Breathe, breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
(The Dream Crabs are on their backs, twitching, then they turn to dust. A little later, they retrieve a piece of carapace and put it in a specimen jar while Shona brushed the remains into a dust pan.)
BELLOWS: So these creatures, when their feeding goes wrong, they die?
DOCTOR: The carnivore's hazard. Food has teeth too. You okay?
(Clara is checking herself in a mirror, looking for the hole in her head.)
CLARA: No.
DOCTOR: Good. There are some things we should never be okay about.
CLARA: There doesn't seem to be a wound.
DOCTOR: No. And the pain's still there, isn't it?
SHONA: Is it the ice cream pain? Just here? Cos I've got that.
BELLOWS: It's the cold, I think. Some sort of reaction.
DOCTOR: But only on one side, just that spot there. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
ALBERT: Well, we've all got it.
CLARA: Okay, so why do we all have that pain?
DOCTOR: Theorise.
CLARA: Don't treat me like a beginner. I was dreaming, then I woke up. I know that.
DOCTOR: Do you? And have you ever woken up from a dream and discovered that you're still dreaming? Dreams within dreams. Dream states nested inside each other. All perfectly possible, especially when we are dealing with creatures who have weaponised our dreams against us.
BELLOWS: I don't know about anybody else, but I'm pretty certain I'm awake right now.
DOCTOR: Which is odd, when you think about it.
ASHLEY: Odd?
DOCTOR: Impossible, in fact. How can any of us be awake?
SHONA: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Remember how we all first met, in the infirmary?
(The Doctor chivying Shona to move.)
DOCTOR [memory]: Come on, quick, quick, come on.
ASHLEY [memory]: Go! Run, now!
DOCTOR: All those creatures coming down from the ceiling, attacking us.
ALBERT [memory]: Here they come!
(Clara screaming.)
DOCTOR: We never stood a chance. How did we survive that?
SHONA: Well, we, we were rescued.
DOCTOR: Yeah, we were rescued. And who was it that rescued us?

[Control room]

(The man in the red suit is on his mobile phone.)
SANTA: No, no, no, no. I need you to do the east coast right now. Well, otherwise you're going to be delivering to the islands in broad daylight. Yeah, listen. Please try and remember that our mugshots are on every Christmas card. Yeah, just get it done, head towards the northern lights. Yes, I remembered to switch them on.
(Santa walks away.)
DOCTOR: The Helman-Ziegler test. The only reliable dream test that I know. Ah. Your base manual. I take it none of you have memorised this.
SHONA: Oh. I haven't, I haven't read it.
DOCTOR: These books should be identical in the real world. But as they don't exist in your memory, in a dream, they can't be. Agreed? Clara. Give me any two digit number.
CLARA: Fifty seven.
DOCTOR: All right, all of you, turn to page fifty seven and look at the very first word. Right, when I point at you.
ASHLEY: Isotope.
DOCTOR: Well?
BELLOWS: Extremely.
ALBERT: Inside.
SHONA: Chocolate. Why did I get chocolate? What's that about?
ALBERT: This can't be right. We must have got it wrong, that's all.
DOCTOR: Well, we'll do it again. Clara?
CLARA: Twenty four.
DOCTOR: Twenty four.
ASHLEY: We.
BELLOWS: Are.
ALBERT: All.
DOCTOR: Shona?
SHONA: Dead.
ASHLEY: Since the attack in the infirmary, nothing has been real?
DOCTOR: The attack is still going on. This is it!
ALBERT: We've been dreaming since then?
SANTA: Oh, for Easter's sake! Of course you've been dreaming. Haven't you been paying attention?
IAN: Rudolph. Did you see the nose?
WOLF: The North Pole? Come on, with stripes?
IAN: This
WOLF: Is
IAN + WOLF + SANTA: A dream!
SANTA: How much more obvious do you want me to make it? Because I can text the Easter Bunny, you know.
DOCTOR: Seriously? You're trying to help?
SANTA: As you stand here, chatting, chatting, your lives are ending. Unless you wake up, unless you free yourselves from these dreadful creatures, they're, they're going to destroy you.
SHONA: You're a dream who's trying to save us?
SANTA: Shona, sweetheart, I'm Santa Claus. I think you just defined me.
DOCTOR: This makes perfect sense. The Dream Crab tries to make the dream as real as possible to trap you inside it. It creates dreams within dreams so you can never be sure if you are really awake. But your brain knows something is wrong. Your subconscious fights back. This is your mind trying to tell you this isn't real.
SANTA: So it gives you me. Sweet Papa Chrimbo.
IAN: It gives you comedy elves, flying reindeer.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
SANTA: A time-travelling scientist dressed as a magician.
IAN: Classic!
DOCTOR: No. No, no. Hang on. No, no, no, no.
WOLF: Living in a phone box.
DOCTOR: It's a spaceship in disguise.
SANTA: You see how none of this makes any sense?
DOCTOR: Shut up, Santa.
SANTA: I have watched over you all your lives. I've taken care of you from Christmas to Christmas.
BELLOWS: But you're not real.
SANTA: And yet that never stopped me. All of you, come near. Come here, come on. Join hands.
DOCTOR: Look. No. Look, we don't need all this touchy-feely stuff.
SANTA: Shut up, Doctor. Join hands. Come on, concentrate.
BELLOWS: Why?
SANTA: You are deep inside this dream, all right, and it is a shared mental state, so it is drawing power from the multi-consciousness gestalt which has now formed telepathically and
DOCTOR: No. No, No, no, no. Line in the sand. Santa Claus does not do the scientific explanation.
SANTA: All right. As the Doctor might say, (Scottish accent) Oh, it's all a bit dreamy-weamy.
DOCTOR: Why don't you just go and, and make a naughty list?
SANTA: I have, mate, and you're on it.
DOCTOR: Don't give me that. Look, you're supposed to be warm and friendly and cheerful.
SANTA: (Scots) Oh, yeah. Well, look at your great bedside manner.
DOCTOR: Don't be so hostile,
CLARA: Doctor, behave.
ASHLEY: This is very sweet. But right now I have an alien life form wrapped around my face, and apparently it's digesting my brain. When you speak, how do I know it's not the Dream Crab?
SANTA: Ooo, good question. Spoken like a scientist.
CLARA: Can I put it another way? Why would the part of our brain that is trying to keep all of us alive choose you for a face?
SANTA: Is anyone else asking that?
SHONA: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. All of us. All of us. Why you?
SANTA: Why me? It's the North Pole, it's Christmas Day. You're dying. Who you gonna call? Just one last time, huh? One last Christmas, as if your lives depended on it. Please! Ho, ho, ho. Believe in Santa.
(They all shrug and form a circle.)
DOCTOR: I'm not very good with this holdy-hand thing.
CLARA: Tough.
DOCTOR: I will hold Clara's hand, but that's it.
CLARA: Shona, take his hand.
DOCTOR: Oh no, I'm fine, I'm fine. This is very Christmassy, isn't it?
ASHLEY: Okay, so what do we
(Santa, Ian and Wolf have vanished.)
BELLOWS: Where did he go?
DOCTOR: We're waking up. That part of the dream is over. We're on our own now.
ALBERT: Well, then. What do we do?
DOCTOR: That pain in your head. Make it worse. Head towards it.
ASHLEY: So when we wake up, what do we expect?
DOCTOR: Only a few moments will have passed at the most. The attack is still in progress.
SHONA: I'm scared.
DOCTOR: Congratulations. That means you're not an idiot.
CLARA: It's not like the last time.
DOCTOR: Last time wasn't real.
ASHLEY: Good luck. Stay calm. And God bless us, every one.
(Whiteout.)

[Infirmary]

(Dream Crabs fall from the faces of the four scientists, the Doctor and Clara, as the Sleepers clutch their sides and writhe. They all cough violently to clear the mucus as the Dream Crabs twitch and turn to dust.)
DOCTOR: Run!
(One of the Sleepers grabs Clara's arm.)
CLARA: Argh.
DOCTOR: Clara!
CLARA: Doctor!
(It opens its maw and the Doctor pulls her free. She is staring at the pink tube inside the gap.)
DOCTOR: Clara? Come on!
ASHLEY: Out, out, now! NOW!
(They back out with the guns and the doors close.)

[Corridor]

(Bellows hits a stray hand with the butt of her gun until the doors can fully shut.)
DOCTOR: Everyone all right? Good. Bye.
CLARA: Sorry, I'll just go and
(They walk down the corridor.)
DOCTOR: No need for chatting, you'll only get attached. This isn't Facebook.

[Outside the base]

CLARA: Er, what about the Dream Crabs?
DOCTOR: Oh, they're fine.
CLARA: And the people that they're eating?
DOCTOR: Beyond help.
CLARA: Doctor, the others are still in danger.
DOCTOR: Only if they're stupid. There are polar bears on this ice cap. Am I supposed to do something about that, too?
CLARA: We know Dream Crabs are still on Earth.
DOCTOR: There are lots of dangerous things on this funny little planet of yours, Clara, most of which you eat. I'm the Doctor, not your mam.
(He walks to the Tardis.)
CLARA: Doctor? If Santa was only in the dream, why was he on my roof?
DOCTOR: Four. Four patients. Four manuals. Hurry! Do you know what I hate about the obvious?
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: Missing it.
(They run back inside.)

[Control room]

(On the monitors, the Sleepers are back on their beds.)
DOCTOR: As you were. No saluting. Are you the same people as before?
CLARA: Of course they are.
DOCTOR: Oh, sorry, I deleted you.
SHONA: Well, that's not a very nice attitude, is it?
DOCTOR: Four manuals, yes?
ASHLEY: Yes, why?
DOCTOR: One each.
ALBERT: One each, yes. What's the problem?
DOCTOR: Well, the problem is, you can't see the problem. For instance, you, gobby one.
(He throws a manual to Shona.)
SHONA: I have a name, actually.
DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. I don't need it. When we first met you in the infirmary, what were you doing?
SHONA: Mmm. It's a long story.
DOCTOR: Uptight boss one. (another manual) What is the primary mission of this polar base?
ASHLEY: It's a long story.
DOCTOR: Sexy one. What brings you to the North Pole at your age?
BELLOWS: It's a long (pause) story.
CLARA: Okay, why are they all giving the same answer, because that is a tiny bit freaky.
DOCTOR: If you think that's freaky, try this. We were in the Tardis. Why did we come here?
CLARA: It's a long story.
(The penny drops.)
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Dreams. They're funny. Ha, ha, ha. They're disjointed. They're, they're silly. They're full of gaps. But you don't notice, because the dream protects itself. Stops you asking the right questions. For example, why do you have four manuals, one each, when you have a crew of eight? Or did you forget about your friends in the infirmary here?
ALBERT: But we woke up.
DOCTOR: Dreams within dreams, I warned you.
BELLOWS: This isn't a dream. I know it isn't.
DOCTOR: No one knows they're not dreaming. Not one of us. Not ever. Not for one single moment of our lives. Clara? Page number. Make it a good one.
CLARA: Twelve.
(Everyone opens their manual at the number of the Doctor.)
ASHLEY: Very.
ALBERT: Very.
BELLOWS: Very.
SHONA: Dead.
DOCTOR: And who's going to be the first to admit it?
ASHLEY: Admit what?
DOCTOR: That the pain is still there.
SHONA: Actually, I think it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is an alien organism in your brain, eating it. Of course it's getting worse.
CLARA: Doctor? What are they doing?
(On the monitor, the Sleepers are sitting up on their beds.)
DOCTOR: Factually, getting up. Significantly, sensing the endgame.
CLARA: How?
ASHLEY: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Well, look at them. Go on. Look at them. Look at them properly. Look who they are. They're you. The Sleepers are you.
(Close up of a name badge - Prof Rona Bellows.)
SHONA: How can they be us?
(Shona McCullough)
DOCTOR: Because we're dreaming, all of us. This base isn't real. None of us are actually standing in the room. I'm probably asleep in my Tardis. Clara, you must be in bed. God knows where the rest of you are, probably scattered all over the world. But wherever you are, the Dream Crabs have got us, and we're all being networked into the same nightmare.
BELLOWS: What are they doing?
(The Sleepers are walking towards the cameras.)
DOCTOR: It's your subconscious again. The Sleepers represent the part of your mind that's already surrendered to the attack. These are dream images of what's coming to kill you.
ALBERT: That's me? That's actually me?
DOCTOR: No, it's a metaphorical construct representing a psychic attack within a shared dreamscape. Do please keep up.
ALBERT: But it's me.
DOCTOR: Don't get too close.
(Sleeper Albert puts its hand up to the camera, and Albert leans into the monitor.)
ALBERT: Why?
DOCTOR: Because this is a nightmare.
(Albert gets grabbed by the Sleeper's hand and pulled through the monitor with a scream. The Doctor and Clara try to grab him.)
DOCTOR: No! Clara!
(Ashley and Bellows reach out to their Sleeper images on the screens.)
DOCTOR: Look out, they're coming through. Out! Outside, now! Run, run, run, run! Run! Clara, run. Run, all of you, run. Run!
(The Sleepers are in the control room. The Doctor tries to use a fire extinguisher on them but it doesn't slow them down.)

[Outside the base]

(He bars the door and sonicks the lock. Shona, Ashley and Bellows have acquired duffel coats.)
BELLOWS: We'll freeze to death out here.
SHONA: But it, it's just a dream.
DOCTOR: This dream just killed your friend. Start taking it seriously.
SHONA: Where's Albert? Where's the professor?
DOCTOR: He probably just woke up somewhere in the real world, dead. If we don't wake up now, we'll do the same.
CLARA: But how?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
(The Sleepers thump the door, making fist marks in the thick metal.)
DOCTOR: The Tardis! Come on! Come on!
CLARA: Doctor, it's not the real Tardis.
DOCTOR: Well, let's hope that I dreamed it really well, then.
(The Tardis doors open, and Sleeper Doctor and Sleeper Clara come out.)
CLARA: It's us.
DOCTOR: Of course it's us. We're dreaming too.
SHONA: Oh, my God.
BELLOWS: How is that possible? How can there be so many?
(They are surrounded by dozens of Sleeper versions of themselves.)
DOCTOR: The logic of a nightmare.
(Ashley lights a flare.)
SHONA: So tell us how to wake up. Because you're always talking like you're so clever, going on and on. So tell us what to do!
DOCTOR: We have to leave this place.
SHONA: Leave it?
BELLOWS: How?
DOCTOR: Use your imagination.
BELLOWS: Excuse me?
DOCTOR: Dream yourselves home.
BELLOWS: (panicking) But how?
DOCTOR: Come on, it's Christmas, the North Pole. Who you gonna call?
(Jingle, jingle. They look up to see a bright red light fly across the full moon then swoop down to land.)
SANTA: Hyah! Whoa! Whoa. Ah. Get in the sleigh.
(They do, the Doctor sitting next to Santa and Clara behind him.)
SANTA: Fortunately, I know all your home addresses. Yah!
(Rudolph, Donner and Blitzen pull the sleigh up into the sky.)

[Sleigh]

CLARA: So what happens now?
SANTA: Hyah!
CLARA: This is us just waking up, right?
DOCTOR: Could be. Well, I hope so. Waking up or
CLARA: Or?
DOCTOR: Just focus on this. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
CLARA: I've always believed in Santa Claus. But he looks a little different to me.
(Clara put her arms around the Doctor.)
CLARA: Look!
(She points down at old Father Thames.)
SANTA: Hey. You want to take the reins, Doctor?
DOCTOR: You're a dream construct, currently representing either my recovering or expiring mind.
SANTA: Yes, but do you want a go?
DOCTOR: Yeah. All right.
(The Doctor takes over the reins as they pass St Pauls. Everyone goes ooo!)
DOCTOR: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
(They slalom between roof tops.)
SANTA: Easy! This way.
DOCTOR: No, no, no! Oh, ho ho! Ah!
SANTA: Up a bit. Lift up. There we go.
DOCTOR: Look at me. Look. Look at me!
(They reach the Houses of Parliament as Big Ben chimes midnight. Everyone whoops with excitement as they fly around it they head off north westerly and climb above the cloud layer.)
DOCTOR: Look at me! I'm riding a sleigh. I'm riding a sleigh. Yippee ai-yay!
(They head upwards.)
DOCTOR: Oh. Maybe you could
(He gives the reins back, panting for breath.)
SANTA: Yeah, yeah.
SHONA: I work in a shop.
ASHLEY: I'm sorry?
SHONA: I thought I was a scientist. That's rubbish.
BELLOWS: Finally, something that makes sense.
SHONA: You're horrible, you.
ASHLEY: Perfume.
SHONA: What?
ASHLEY: I'm an account manager for perfume. Does this mean we're waking up?
DOCTOR: Possibly. With any luck, we'll all wake up in our proper times and places.
CLARA: Proper times?
DOCTOR: Well, we could all be from different time zones. Time travel is always possible, in dreams.
SHONA: We might not know each other? Not any of us?
ASHLEY: No, possibly not.
SHONA: Well, you know what we should do? We should swap numbers. We should have a reunion.
ASHLEY: Bellows!

[Bellow's home]

(Bellows wakes up in a bright room with a piano. A young girl comes into the room.)
GIRL: Gran! Dinner's ready.
BELLOWS: Yeah, sorry, I must have dozed off.
(She puts her glasses back on, sees where she is sitting with a bit of disappointment, then wheels herself past the crumbled remains of her Dream Crab on the wooden floor.)

[Sleigh]

SHONA: Er, now I'm pretty sure I can remember my number so, if you memorise it, then you text me, we can go for a curry and
DOCTOR: The chances of you remembering any of this are very slim.
SHONA: Well, don't say that. We'll remember, won't we, Ashley? Ashley?
(Ashley wakes up in bed, with her Dream Crab dying beside her. She leaps out of bed with a scream.)
SHONA: Am I next? Is it me now?
CLARA: Shona, you're going home. You're surviving.
SHONA: Do you want to hang out sometime? We can just hang out.
CLARA: Sure.
SHONA: Santa, can I stay a bit longer?
(Shona has vanished.)

[Shona's flat]

(Shona wakes up on her sofa with the Dream Crab twitching and squealing on the floor before it turns to dust.)
SHONA: Gross!
(She picks up the piece of paper with her Christmas Day Itinerary on it. 1. DVD (Alien) 2. DVD (The thing from another world) 3. Dad comes round. 4. DVD (Miracle on 34th Street.) 5. THRONES marathon. 6. Forgive Dave??? She thinks for a moment, then picks up her marker pen and ticks number 6.)

[Sleigh]

CLARA: It's a pity we have to wake up, really. It's not really something we do every day, is it?
SANTA: No, no. Strictly once a year.
DOCTOR: We stay, we die, Clara.
CLARA: You're always such a downer, Doctor.
(But he has gone.)

[Volcanic ledge]

(The Dream Crab falls off, he sits up coughing in the place where she threw the Tardis keys into the lava. Please don't tell me everything since then has been a dream...)
DOCTOR: Clara!
(He dashes into the Tardis.)

[Sleigh]

SANTA: You really should be waking up too, Clara.
CLARA: Just a little longer.
SANTA: Why?
(Clara rests her head on his shoulder.)
CLARA: Every Christmas is last Christmas.
SANTA: Hyah!
(The sleigh flies in front of the full moon.)

[Clara's bedroom]

(The Tardis materialises outside the house. The Doctor carries a specimen jar into her bedroom, where she is still in bed with a Dream Crab on her face.)
DOCTOR: Oh, Clara. I might have known that you would be the one to sleep in. Okay, I tracked the psychic signal here. I'm pretty sure that I know how to do this now. One of the advantages of actually being awake. So, you just hold still. I've just got to zap the neural centres.
(He does so with his sonic screwdriver.)
DOCTOR: Okay, there you go.
(He pulls the Crab off her face and puts it into specimen jar 16367//K8.)
DOCTOR: The Dream Crabs must have got to me first then found you in my memory. The others were collateral damage. Well, good to see you properly at last. How long has it been? Clara.
(Clara switches on her bedside lamp to reveal her grey hair and wrinkled skin.)
CLARA: Oh, you know. About sixty two years. Doctor, I have missed you very much, you stupid old man.
(She laughs and they hug.)
DOCTOR: I've missed you, too.

[Clara's living room]

DOCTOR: These are Christmas hats, I've seen people use them. You put them on and absolutely anything seems funny.
CLARA: Oh, probably won't work on you.
DOCTOR: Probably not. You want to try?
CLARA: Go on, then.
(He puts the yellow paper crown on Clara and she becomes her younger self.)
CLARA: Can you really see no difference in me?
DOCTOR: Clara Oswald, you will never look any different to me. So, how was it then?
CLARA: How was what?
DOCTOR: The sixty two years that I missed.
CLARA: Oh, how was my life, you mean?
DOCTOR: Is there a Mister Clara?
(We see the old version again.)
CLARA: No. But there were plenty of proposals.
DOCTOR: They all turned you down though?
CLARA: I turned them down. I travelled. I taught in every country in Europe. I learned to fly a plane.
DOCTOR: Regrets?
CLARA: Oh, hundreds. I just wish there were time for a few more.
DOCTOR: Yeah, they're always the best part. Christmas cracker. We should do one. No one ever matched up to Danny, eh?
CLARA: There was one other man, but that would never have worked out.
DOCTOR: Why not?
CLARA: He was impossible.
(The Doctor holds Clara's hand to help her pull the cracker.)
DOCTOR: We should do this every Christmas.
CLARA: Because every Christmas is last Christmas.
(The cracker is pulled.)
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I was stupid. I should have come back earlier. I wish that I had.
SANTA: Do you, Doctor? How much do you wish that?
DOCTOR: No. I'm not still
SANTA: Wakey, wakey!

[Volcanic ledge]

(Once again the Dream Crab falls off.)
DOCTOR: Clara!

[Clara's bedroom]

(Again the Dream Crab is sonicked, this time from young Clara's face.)
CLARA: Doctor. Am I young?
DOCTOR: No idea.
(He gets a mirror for her to look in.)
DOCTOR: Is that any good?
CLARA: Oh, that's good.
DOCTOR: The Tardis is outside.
CLARA: So?
DOCTOR: So, all of time and all of space is sitting out there. A big blue box. Please, don't even argue.
(Clara thinks about it with a big grin on her face, then gives him her hand and kisses his cheek.)
CLARA: Merry Christmas, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas, Clara Oswald.

[Outside Clara's home]

CLARA: Well, look at you, all happy. That's rare.
